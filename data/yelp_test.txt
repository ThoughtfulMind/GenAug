i got my hair and make up done here for my wedding on 12 29 13 . everything was amazing . hannah styled my hair and the results were pure perfection . i wish my hair could look like that everyday . i only have positive things to say about this place and would definitely recommend this place . i loved everything about this place !
you know how you get those survey thingys online after a visit or a stay somewhere ? well , i got one of those in my inbox a couple of weeks ago . another place to bitch , other than yelp facebook ? ! ? why not ! . so , i filled it out . i got an e mail apologizing for such a crappy stay an offer for a tower suite . not to mention , after complaining on their facebook page as well , they responded right away saying how sorry they were would look into it , etc . i'm so not used to a facility , company , organization , etc . caring so much about their services . i honestly did not expect to get any sort of response what so ever , so the fact that i did twice ! totally earns palace another star . i wish i could give half stars , because i think they deserve more than 3 , but not yet a 4 . i will be using my free room when i go back in sept for my bachelorette party . whooo !
chicken . fried . steak . hands down the best i've ever , ever had . the gravy here is the best i've ever had period . you will be hard pressed to find a better place for down home breakfast in the country let alone az . what's really not to like about this place the service is awesome the food is amazing and heck even their coffee is great . if you haven't been here before , come on the weekend , early , because that's the only time you can get the chicken fried steak and eggs . cheers !
hands down the best bbq place i've tasted by far ! i've had bbq from a lot of places in the states and in montreal and this place is oh so good ! i just got home from it and had to write my review . first . service was very good considering the fact that it was a new staff . super nice , friendly , patient . i can go on . especially because i was with my husband and his colleagues . all construction workers that were kinda tipsy , loud and hungry ! . the waiters and chef owner were up to par . i am a sucker for hood service and this place delivers it all ! food hands down the best bbq place you can find here in montreal . to me the best all around . i ordered the trinity . beef brisket , beef ribs and pork ribs . deliciously tender , tasty , fall of the bone . you don't need any sauce like some other place . trust me . sides mac and cheese . cheesy goodness . coleslaw . perfect freshness and crunch . baked beans . tender sweetness . bring your appetite because the portions are generous ! this is the place to go if you want real , authentic and heavenly tasting bbq ! no wonder they won the jack daniels bbq contest ! chef , your food speaks your passion . bravo !
oh my god today i decided to try bosa donuts and i got a buttermilk donut today with a thai tea with boba and now i am addicted . i was shocked to see that you can get 1 dozen donut holes for . 99 cents . my coworkers will love me on friday .
my and my son come here every thursday after his therapy . he looks forward to coming here every week the staff know us and already know our order on sub combo and one soup . i i love how they say hi and always say goodbye see you guys next week it really makes our day love the staff and the subs with fresh meat slices is delicious and fresh !
i liked the concept of this place , with the outside vibe and self serve beer wall . however , every single person i encountered there was rude , condescending , or just plain thoughtless . long story short , i was charged for beer i didn't drink and when i tried to get a credit for it , the server i spoke with treated me like a criminal who was lying to steal $ 5 worth of beer that , again , i did not drink . i then asked a bartender for a food menu and when i tried to order food less than 5 minutes later , she told me that the kitchen was closed . so why hand me a food menu ? i found out later that they ended up re opening the kitchen and i saw servers walking around with food . the only reason i'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is they had some really awesome dj's there this was on friday , 6 29 who got me and my friends excited to get on the dance floor ! literally the only redeeming quality . this was my first and last time going here . there are plenty of better bars and restaurants in the area who don't treat their customers like crap .
loved the location of the store , of course the products carried in store are amazing . my husband was interested in a dinner jacket and we were trying to get service to pick the right one and both sales associates were chatting away at the register , and we had to ask for assistance , input and service . even then , the associate that was helping us acted as if we were an inconvenience to him . i've worked in retail and if i were the manager of those two employees , they'd be having a discussion for sure . two stars are knocked off solely because of poor customer service .
today , i visited masso osteria for the first time and i did not expect my visit to go the way it did . i knew it was a nice restaurant but i truly got the full experience here . i was greeted by a lot of enthusiasm from a young hostess who was very kind and gave me all of the information i asked for . she sat us very promptly which was great because i was excited to eat . it is very rare that i have good experiences with hosts , but since i had such a great one with this young lady , i had to ask her name ! she said her name was mackenzie and she was overall a huge part of my great experience at this restaurant . in a lot of restaurants , most of the times , a host ess will not treat you in the best way possible or just simply in a 'not caring' type of way . i believe that in order to have a great time at a restaurant , it all starts with the greeting because personally i start to form my opinion about a restaurant as soon as i walk in . my server was amazing and provided us with great details about the menu . i had never been to this restaurant so she helped me a lot in the process of choosing what to eat . however , i can't seem to remember her name now ! i must say , the salad was very refreshing . thank you for the awesome time ! i will be coming back soon !
the veal piccata was exquisite and my husband thoroughly enjoyed lobster ravioli . shared the house salad and it was fresh and plenty for two . thank you for our complimentary desert , it was the perfect finish . staff was awesome as always .
let me preface this review with this vegas is really just not my thing , but i was hoping that gordon ramsay would be a little less vegas than some of the other restaurants . i was wrong . everything was over sized , over done , etc . the british theme was overkill , the prices were overkill completely expected , but i have to say that the service here was excellent . we had an awesome server whose name is escaping me , but he was wonderful . i didn't care too much for the food , but my friends really liked it , so maybe this just wasn't my place . i was content with the fairly extensive wine list , especially for a pub like restaurant . i probably won't be back to gordon ramsay pub grill but i probably won't be back to vegas either .
what great place . ! it is much better than any korean bbq restaurants in la . such as baekjung , parks bbq , agassi gopchang etc i will be back definitely . i want to give 6 star if possible .
i typically like to wait several weeks before trying a new place to let them get their shit together , but grabbagreen was calling to me . it's in the former yoforia space in the epicentre . the shop is very clean and attractive . there isn't much room to eat in , so i imagine in cold weather it's going to get very snug in there . on a nice day like today , though , the doors are open and it's quite pleasant . a manager told me while we were waiting in line that grabbagreen is structured such that once you've placed your order , you should receive your food in five minutes or fewer . it's a flurry of activity behind the counter there were probably a dozen employees assembling lunches . i got the french quarter grain bowl . it comes with shrimp , brown rice , and avocado . it was a little heavy on the red onion i brushed my teeth when i got back to the office and i can still taste onion ! the meal was around room temperature , which was fine but i feel like i may have enjoyed it more if the rice were warm enough to wilt my spinach . the portions are great , too the little box they handed me seemed small but my lunch left my pleasantly full without being weighed down . for someone like me who lives gluten free , this place is very exciting everything on the menu is naturally gf . it's so nice to not have to ask a million questions or risk getting sick because someone didn't change their gloves . i can choose anything here and feel like i made a smart decision . i think grabbagreen is going to enjoy success in uptown . it's healthy and quick , and the employees are all extremely happy and pleasant .
good to very good gym . some of the machines need to be moved out to make room for newer more useful equip . need another smith machine def and poss another flat bench . and please add some hammer strength
i'm really not sure why i dislike home depot so much but this specific location is ass backwards . i never find what i'm looking for and the employees do a lot of bs'ing and standing around . compared to the shopping experience at lowes , home depot is just bush league . last 3 visits to hd , i ended up going to lowes to find what i needed . save yourself some time and money , go to dunn or lowes instead .
i come here often since 2007 with my family of 6 . excellent food . welcoming service . relaxed atmosphere . true hidden gem of toronto .
this place will rip you off . we had a ring at our door , by the time we got to answer it , we saw a van drive away . they had a note on our door that they sprayed , even took $ 49 out of my account . we were home the whole time ! they never sprayed . charged for something they never did . stay away from this company !
came in on a sunday late afternoon to check out the game selection as an alternative to snakes and lattes . i appreciate that there is no cover fee , but there is also no service . we stood awkwardly at the front for a few minutes before we accepted that no one was going to come either to the bar area or to let us know how it worked . we sat down expecting someone to come by . which didn't happen . we didn't get to order a drink because there was never an employee behind the service counter , and no one came to ask . we awkwardly checked out one of the games but mostly sat there , chatting at an empty table , for a good hour and a half before leaving . decent game selection , but overall not the ideal choice .
as good as it gets is right . here's why i chose raxmasters 1 . great reviews . 2 . highest quality material watch the video on their site . 3 . the best price . don't be fooled by competitors sites that appear to be lower , but charge installation and exclude tax . the raxmaster price already includes tax and installation . i couldn't be happier with the two 4x8 super duty racks we had installed . jerry is a friendly professional that takes pride in his work . he and i even did some simultaneous pullups to demonstrate the stability .
best vetrinarian i have ever been to ! i have 2 yellow labs with 2 very different personalities . we parked our car and without fail the dogs both took a poo in the parking lot . they have bags outside to clean up after the dogs . we walked into a beautiful clean waiting room . we were greated with a smile and they were even aware of who we were when we walked in . this was just based on appointment alone . we filled out some paperwork , nothing overwhelming . we were taken back to a nice little room for the examination . the aid came in and weighed both dogs . the vet then came in and examined their teeth and gave the shots . we have one dog that will be nice to anyone and is so loveable . the vet could tell right away that maggie was a very relaxed . on the flip side she could also tell that peja was not as relaxed . she was great with peja and peja even went into the next room with her . this is not something that peja would ever do with anyone . peja only lkes you if you have a tennis ball or a frisbee . peja even let her look at her teeth , which was very scary for me . i thought peja was going to bite her but she didn't . maggie has a hangtag that needs removed from her stomach . i have talked to other vets that wanted to knock her out , keep her overnight , do bloodwork , and a ct scan . ridiculous to say the least . this vet says the bloodwork is necessary because of her age and that she can give her a local anesthetic and it will be over . the do need to keep her for the day but that is it . the vet is also not charging an arm and a leg for the surgery . the only thing i would say is that they don't have alot of modern equipment in the office . i know that they make dog lifts to get dogs on the examination table etc , they do not have this type of equipment . this is the reason i gave them 4 stars . we will use this vet for everything !
ok mex , but not just feels cheap . not open for lunch and the waitstaff would rather be doing something else . why cheap you say ? i went there a year ago and sat at the bar and noticed a very loud fan in the beverage cooler like 70 or 80 db loud . went back 2 months later . still broke . and 3 months later , nope , still broke . last time i was there , it was finally fixed , but this is a sit sown restaurant in a very large casino and you can't get that fixed for nearly a year ? man , talk about cheap !
stopped in because we had a g'pon . craft beer selection was quite nice . bottle selection is pretty decent and they also have an attached beer distributor for cases . walking back to the restroom which was clean , noticed a wide selection of board games which you can pull out and play . observed 4 gents playing magic which they brought with themselves . the night we were there during happy hour they had a fantastic cheese selection . a goat cheese brie , mimolette first time for this fantastic cheese , smoked gouda , swiss and 3 other selections . my beer selection for the evening was troegs mad elf and the wife chose wittekerke rose an belgian import . for an appetizer we ordered the hummas platter . the platter had warm pitas , feta , balsamic tomatoes and pitted kalmata olives . very good . judee ordered the lobster roll with fresh cut fries and coleslaw . the lobster was very large chunks with a good taste . the fresh cut fries are very good . i ordered the reubenation which came with fresh cut fries . the sandwich had 4 slices of bread in a stacked combination . a little to much bread but tasted good . fries as above . prices were fair and the g'pon made the meal super easy on the wallet . service was professional and the well informed of menu and beer selections . will patronize when in the area without the incentive .
great food ! i love there broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl ! there customer service is pretty good but could use a little work ! overall good place
i love going here for facials and to get my eyebrows done . always friendly , they appreciate that people are busy , they get you in and out quickly but do a good job when they do it . you dont feel rushed .
this place is so unique and fun . such a great vibe . we came here when it was storming like crazy outside and immediately felt like we were on vacation . could this place be cleaned up alittle . yes . but it's a bar through and through . they had great live music which is always something i love . the bartender was very nice and fun to talk to .
too expensive $ 12 . i never got in cause of the price my baby is only 10 mos old and the owner wouldnt even give us a discount . i endend up going somewhere bigger and only paid $ 5 and $ 10 for 4 yr old .
this hit the spot in terms of junk food . burger was was pretty good . onion rings were crispy . the hot dog was good , but the girl put too much ketchup , mustard and relish .
this is one of those places where you'll either like it or not . but since it's one of pittsburgh's famous food attractions , it's an experience a person should try at least once . first time i ordered the cheesesteak minus the cheese with an extra egg on top . never had fries in a sandwich before and i liked that the coleslaw had no mayo . fried eggs always makes sandwiches 10x better . second time i ordered the pastrami . didn't enjoy it as much as the cheesesteak . for some reason , i couldn't stomach the fries and coleslaw this time around . the coleslaw started having a weird taste after a few bites and the fries were just weird and soggy . mixed together with the squishy pastrami , definitely wasn't as good of an experience as my first time here . still , definitely come here , especially if you're hungry and need an outrageously large sandwich for a cheap price . it's like two meals in one .
it was my first time here . i really liked the place the food was good and the server was nice and polite . the only thing that spoiled the lovely experience was the check where the price of my drink wasn't the same as on the menu . the server fixed it right away , and it was only a dollar difference bus still wasn't very pleasant so check you bill . other than that i liked everything .
after waking up at noon and missing brunch buffet , we decided to go to this quaint little french cafe inside paris . we had a nice dinner at picasso that night so we didn't want to be too full , so we got there around 1 , but the service was so slow and we didn't get our food and finish eating until almost 3 pm . i think we finally got out of the place around 3 30 and by then , we had to go back to our hotel to change and stuff . i think we waited literally 20 minutes for our check because the waiter loves to chat it up with all the other tables . the actual food was decent . i think i had the gruyere cheese , bacon and , onion burger , which was pretty good . the frites fries were kind of weird because they were like regular fries but squashed flat and then refried . a little too much . also tried some chicken b . l . t and steak sandwich with caramelized onions , which were decent . i think the best thing i tried was the steak bordelaise , which was really juicy and tender . maybe we should have went for weekend brunch , which might have been better with some breakfast foods . regardless , service needs to speed up a bit . it was somewhat french , but i don't think they were trying to imitate the carefree attitude of dining and taking your time in france .
not sure what all the positive reviews are for , i went here the other day and was not the least bit impressed . i heard good things about their cheesesteaks , and since i have never had a cheesesteak before i thought i'd try them out . there wasn't much meat in the sandwich , and it lacked cheese . i told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich . even their salad was terrible , the ranch was runny and it didn't even have any croutons on it . the prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty . will never go back again .
i typically like pita jungle for a quick meal with the family . the server at this location was nice but the kitchen staff really needs to go back for some training . initially it took a while to receive the food as it came one plate at a time . also the quality is not as good as the one in arrowhead on bell or in phoenix . don't waste your time with the rice pudding , it was basically water with rice and sugar .
i am so impressed with this place . we were hoping to pick up a few cupcakes for an impromptu birthday party and happened to be in the neighborhood . it turns out the we were there almost an hour after closing and they were so kind to open their doors and allow us to pick up the most delicious cupcakes ! i highly recommend the lemon one with raspberry filling , but every single one that we purchased was extraordinary .
service was subpar , food was over cooked , tried asking manager question and he didn't seem to really care . won't be back to a tilted kilt as just too loud !
dr . russell has helped me with back adjustments and spinal alignment on quite a few occasions . he is a holistic chiropractor and knows a lot about how one's health and diet can affect back pain and other ailments . this is good because anytime i am unwell , i like to know the root cause and how i can heal it myself where possible before resorting to any type of prescription medication or surgery . one reviewer said that dr . russell pushed vitamins each time but i have not had this experience with him . he is very friendly , easy going and doesn't appear to have a hidden agenda to sell anything . the staff are friendly too . i highly recommend russell chiropractic !
worst service in town , liars , they say they done jobs that they never did , they change one sensor on my car but they never check wires they were cut , they change oil and filter to my car and since this day my engine start making noice , i took my car to an other mechanic and this happened because they use a shit oil very cheap , i change it again with good oil and noice disappeared , every time that i go for smog test service is really bad maybe because they charge very cheap price but should not be like that because they put the price no the costumers . for this reasons and more i not going there anymore . not recommended at all .
the lounge is basically the upper floor of st . louis with dimmer lights . the food is the same and the beer is the same . it gets packed on tuesday nights because of the half price wings . come early if you want seats . they also have a small patio . if you're low on cash , there's an atm located downstairs inside st . louis . don't expect great service if the place is packed .
had pizza and wings at fatbob's this evening and was way impressed . i usually stick to angelo's in lakewood as my fav but was out on a motorcycle ride and decided to try it out . deep dish was awesome and wings were so good that we ordered a second batch . tell your friends to try our this great , family owned , harley inspired pizza shop and more . it's worth the trip .
i had to sit back and realize this restaurant deserved an update on my previous review . i continue to stand tall about exploring more kid menu options that make sense . it's difficult to get younger children to maintain the plant based eating habits . you have an opportunity to truly craft a solution that is much needed in this town , and in my favorite type of food , mexican . taking this need and owning it could go a long way ! it's also not advantageous as a parent to order the quesadilla and it be over $ 7 . i wanted to just get that tidbit out of the way so i can reinforce that aside from the suggestion this restaurant still receives top marks . the enchiladas are amazing , sopes and posole just the way i remember , as well as street tacos and other popular favorites ! you get red or green sauce , or when you takeout both , and it's phenomenal . i took advantage of the $ 1 vegan donuts and yea , just had to . so delicious . panchos has become a frequent choice in my house and i'm always excited to try new dishes on their menu . the have taco tuesday and follow their facebook page for the occasional special offers or new meals !
the only late night 24hr restaurant in the cosmopolitan . came here for a bite to eat around 12 30 1 30am during my stay at the cosmopolitan . late night menu was limited on choices . i ordered the french onion soup and buffalo style chicken wings . the french onion soup was good but nothing out of this world . they accidentally gave my chicken wings to another table and i had to wait forever to get a new order out . the waiter apologized but offered no concessions for the restaurant's mistake and my inconvenience . my friends' food came out way before my chicken wings did and i had to play catch up to try and finish them before heading out to the casino floor . i was really unhappy with the service here , considering there was only 4 other tables with guests and the place was not busy at all . the atmosphere is cool , right across from the bond bar . the dj was spinning great music and the vibe felt nice . too bad service sucked and food was mediocre . price was ok considering it is inside the cosmopolitan and everything there is usually very expensive .
my husband and i drove down from payson after finding this spot online worth the drive ! loved the setting in an old historic home . we sat on the porch swing outside drinking a hot chai tea latte and cold brew which was awesome , very smooth no bitter after taste ! . wish we had brought a book along , would have stayed for a longer time . we will be back
terrible rude people working the place . i can not believe how i was treated , for no reason . i had to put my things back , it's like they wanted me to leave . im shocked people act like that ? and work with the public , it's a shame
this has become one of my favourite lunch places in the downtown core . plates are consistently full of flavour and ingredients are top notch . the menu has changed a bit earlier this year i've been told the crusted pickerel and lamb shoulder are my favourites . both are on the revised menu . both are equally addictive . very busy at lunch so reservations needed . nice ontario wines compliment . coffee is pressed and important to negate the wine when going back to work . a must visit when doing holiday shopping at the bay .
my final bill at autobahn was 50 less for the exact same work the audi dealer was going to $ charge me . yup , 50 ! when i mentioned to michael that i was thinking about selling my car in the fall , he took the time to explain things to me so that i understood what work needed to be done and the things i could hold off on doing . michael and his business partner chose to be honest and charge a fair price . a huge thank you to all the other yelpers who gave michael and his top notch technicians 5 stars . without your reviews , i wouldn't have even considered going anywhere else for service other than the place where i bought my car .
nice place . ordered the spicey fish tacos . taste was good . maybe need a lil bit more fish but overall a nice ordered . especially since it was not listed on the menu . the batata fries were just right . and what can be said but nice things about the scenery
what a great spot . if you're looking for authentic style tacos this is the spot ! the meat is juicy and flavorful and they such a wide variety salsas . my only complaint would be they didn't have margaritas . definitely worth checking out
i took my daughters glasses back to the store because the arm came off . she was hit in the face during a dodgeball game at school , and they fixed her glasses no problem . i was actually afraid she busted them because the piece seemed to be bent , but the gentleman took his time and fixed them . the staff is extremely courteous , friendly , helpful , and the store has a nice selection of eyewear . i highly recommend vision works .
worst customer service every time i go here . it's so irritating . i buy a bunch of things and i'm literally struggling to carry my shit and these stupid ass workers just talk to other associates and not giving a damn . i had to ask for a damn bag and they said they don't have anymore . like what the flying shit ? ! i always see this one girl dude that works here and last time i asked her for help and she he gave me a fucking attitude . management clearly doesn't give a fuck since i complained like 3 times already . the workers also don't know where the fuck shit is . they would point you to places and when you get there , it ain't even there . they act like they're recovering but i see y'all just talking to other workers . last time i asked someone something and they seriously said umm i don't know . and i answered back you don't know ? and she just walked away . so i asked another associate and the same shit happened and i was telling her that the customer service in this store freakin sucks and she just stares and continues to fix the go backs . these people don't help you and they just stare . so ridiculous . if it wasn't for the wide variety and great sales here i would be going to another store . i have so many complaints with these workers but this review will be an article so i'll end here .
our softball team went here for dinner on a friday . there were 17 of us . i had the salad room and it was like going to a kitchen in a mobile home . tiny , cramped and full of customers trying to get around . on top of that , it was nothing special , especially for the price . the service was the worst i have ever encountered . no one was asked in 3 1 2 hours you heard me if they wanted another drink . i sat forever , having already eaten salad , for my husband to get his dinner . we were downstairs and some of the couples were in their 80's . we are a strapping 60 years old , so it wasn't too bad for us . when it came time to leave we had to track down the waitress for the bills . i mentioned that we never got another drink , she said it was because we did a presentation . poor excuse , the presentation only lasted 30 minutes , that left 3 hours to get our bills ready and get someone another coke . when we walked away , the assistant manager said to the waitresses , in front of us , smile , it pisses them off even more . needless to say , we will never return to this place again . and we stay in a 4 , 000 person resort , word travels fast .
i went to this restaurant with a group of friends with me and my twin brother being the youngest in our early 40s . they would not serve me alcohol as i did not have my id even though my twin brother showed them his id and they served him . another friend at our table of 6 just had his 60th birthday the day earlier and they wouldn't serve him as he also didn't have his id . this was completely ridiculous so we left after the 4 who were served finished their beer . upon walking out the entrance all of us were served a beer by a lady selling beer out of an ice keg to foot traffic . i've never been to a place that has shown such poor judgement with respect to ids in my life and i will never go back to this place even though the servers were very good looking !
i enjoyed my dining experience ! the atmosphere is very intimate and the architecture is beautiful . you are situated in a treehouse overlooking the crystals shopping mall . my steak was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were to die for ! a little pricey for what you get but you're paying for the experience , my server was very knowledgeable and offered plenty recommendations ! i will be back to celebrate many more special occasions !
got delivery through order it , i ordered pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings , and a lotus roots salad . the dumplings came in a plastic container , but the lotus salad came in a small styrofoam box , when the food arrived the box was open and most of the sauce spilled into the bag . the lotus roots salad $ 6 . 99 is slices of cooked lotus roots soaked in soy sauce , sesame oil , ginger slices and a dozen hot peppers . this dish is very salty because they used too much soy sauce . i used the extra sauce to dip the dumplings afterward . there were 15 pieces of pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings $ 10 . 59 in one order . some of them were a bit burnt on the outside , the dumpling wrappers were thicker than average , and the ratio of the dough was more than the meat . the taste by itself was blend , didn't taste like they marinaded or seasoned the meat before wrapping . this meal left me feeling disappointed and very thirsty .
i have purchased 2 iphones and a macbook air from this experimac in the last 6 months . nadine offers fantastic service and the equipment works great . i wouldn't hesitate to buy any apple product from this store . great prices , great products and great service .
went in for some food on a thursday night at 7pm . i should have taken it as a bad sign when there were only 3 other tables with people at them . i ordered the black and blue sliders which were about the most disgusting hamburgers ive ever eaten in my life . burger was overcooked the caramelized onion was actually so caramelized it was now candied onion . the whole mess was completely inedible . i just paid and left 2 of 3 sliders sitting on the plate . do not come here for the food . the rootbeer and service were actually pretty good but the food was about the worst thing ive ever eaten in my life .
i have gone to laugh factory in vegas several times around 4 5 , i have seen bill daws on at least 2 of my visits to laugh factory . all i can say is if he's headlining , go ! he literally had us all laughing so hard we were crying and our sides hurt from laughing so hard ! he touches on the funny things in life that apply to us all , whether you are married , single , parents , and all cultures . part of his comic genius is when he freestyles and pulls in the audience . i have seen other headliners and several other comedy clubs but if you want your money's worth wait till bill dawes is at laugh factory , you won't regret it . he is hilarious !
these wings weren't bad don't get me wrong but for $ 16 . 50 they are waaaaaay over priced . i have had the burgers here before and thought the value was appropriate , they were very good but i will not get the wings here again . otherwise the service has been good and it's a great atmosphere , just know not everything on the menu is worth the price .
i have to agree with most of the other reviews . the service dept . is terrible . i brought my edge in on tuesday morning , was told by john phillips nice guy that they would look at it today . anyway , three days later they still hadn't even looked at the vehicle . i told them i would just come pick it up . john said sorry for the delay . lol took it to a local place , 30 minutes they diagnosed the problem and i'll have my edge back in the morning .
omg i hadn't had a serendipity frozen hot chocolate in decades and what a delicious treat ! they now have tons of flavors but i went with the classic . soooo yummy . thanks for the yummy nostalgia . i may need to have one of these every day i'm here . sooo highly recommend .
i came here with my bf for a late dinner after a long day of shopping lol . we ordered shredded potato and the cucumber dish to share and i ordered the beef brisket soup for myself . our side dishes came out pretty quick . and we both didn't like the shredded potato . it was really spicy for me and the seasoning wasn't good and it had a very oily taste to it . the cucumbers was okay . the beef brisket had a good amount of meat in it and the broth was flavourful . overall it was a good meal . if i was in the area craving noodles i would come here again , otherwise i wouldn't go out of my way to come here .
we stayed at the new york new york hotel and checked out the menu for this restaurant before leaving . we walked the 2 1 2 miles to get to the restaurant only to be told that they do not have mahi mahi on their menu . they remove the mahi mahi bring their menu six months ago . boy that was disappointing . then we asked him about the beignets for dessert . again another disappointing response from the waitress . so we decided to eat there anyway since we were already there . the waitress was telling us how most men don't like mushroomsand she asked if we wanted mushrooms with our meal . we said yes . our mail came and there were no mushrooms . instead we were told it wasn't mushrooms that they gave us . it was brussels sprouts instead . let me see mushrooms or brussels sprouts . we felt cheated and disappointed . not a very good experience and another 2 . 5 miles back . we should have stayed and ate at the hotel .
born and raised in hawaii and grew up eating authentic hawaiian poke which is just fish with hawaiian seasonings and doesn't include all the add on salad ingredients to build your own . i ate here in march 2018 and at best , this establishment serves poke fusion that shouldn't be confused with authentic hawaiian poke . when eating at establishments that serve poke fusion , i keep mine real simple with just fish and seasonings . poke is all about the fish !
great lunch yet again at koi poke . you have to try it . it is absolutely worth it . i love how fresh all their seafood is .
happy hour review skip the humous , order the sliders , duck fat fries or bruschetta . don't order the martini with the honey and blue , way too sweet .
i love the perk ! they have delicious and reasonably priced meals . and their snack bar oh the cookies , granola bars , muffins , cakes . my mouth drools over their selection ! i usually get overwhelmed and buy too much , stuffing a loaf or 4 in my purse for later . this is not a specialty coffee shop so if you're into judging the balance on your palate of 2 ounce espresso shots , i would not recommend the this cafe but if you love people watching , yummy food , friendly staff , earl grey lattes and free wifi check this joint out !
still a five star place in my opinion . great service , draft beer , salads and flat crust pizza . the salmon arugula salad is awesome and the market thin crust usually is as well . very accommodating for children too !
if you want to talk about attention to detail , thinking things ahead , not greedy with restrictions , pro customer , than here you go . you can tell the manager is also very good and he trains his staff very well . chiptole vs . the place is a 16 v . 1 seed . they have the freshest ingredients , luxuory toppings , luxury sauces , and luxury quality . this place is the mercedes benz of create your own dish and eat restaurants . there is nobody more snobby and judgmental of a restaurant than me and this place gets a well deserved 5 star rating .
don't call george . they charged $ 39 just to give an estimate , then wanted $ 450 to replace a kitchen faucet which i had done by another plumber for $ 85 and another $ 400 to replace a valve in our toilet which was $ 20 part i replaced myself in a half hour they took the top off the toilet , turned off all the supply valves , and when told they were too expensive they left without turning the valves back on or even putting the toilet tank lid back in place .
pathetic customer service . ordered a decaf for my mom . they said they don't brew after noon but they would start a pot . after 7 10 min of waiting i went to check on it and they didn't even have it started yet ! just canceled the order cuz we had to make our movie time .
very rarely does any eatery earn 5 stars from me . kilwins is outstanding . from the tasty free samples to the huge waffle cone of sea salt caramel ice cream , everything was amazing . i tried several different ice cream flavors including toasted coconut , chocolate peanut butter , and mint chocolate chip . each was tastier than the last . oh , and because it was saturday , $ 1 chocolate coated pretzel sticks ! i want to go back just to see what other yummy treats are available . this was my first visit to kilwins but it is f a r from my last . it is an absolute must try if you have even the slightest sweet tooth . kilwins , birkdale village a
i attended a private event at this huge bakery we ate cupcakes and drank champagne . the cupcakes were some of the moistest chocolate cupcakes i have had in a long time . i will definitely return during the day to taste some more of their tasty vittles .
today was my first visit to the joint . i have had lower back issues for years and have been going to a chiropractor for years . but after the same old treatment for years and not seeing any results i decided to try the joint on a recommendation from a work associate . all i have to say is 'wow ! i am really impressed with dr palazzo . he gave me an adjustment like i have never had . i walked out of there feeling 200 better that i did when i walked in . i would highly suggest if you have any back issues . go see 'the joint !
definitely a must when you're in vegas . my boyfriend and i have experienced both day pool clubs and night club tours and you won't regret it . our most recent experience was this past weekend with amanda k and kelsey as our hosts . they're both great and so much fun . from the moment you meet at the meeting point to getting on and off the bus to each stop . if you're looking for a great time and want to really enjoy vegas clubs i definitely recommend turnt up tours . it's byo bottle ! they supply the rest from cranberry to ginger ale . thank you turnt up tours for a great time ! see you soon
i really liked this place . we dropped in for lunch soley based on the yelp reviews . i had the ribeye sandwich with fries . daughter ate the kids chicken with fries and husbby had the patty melt with fries we also tried the fried pickles they were very hot and enough for 2 two people to share . they were very tasty , and the ranch was nice to except for it being to thin . my steak sandwich was realy nice . cooked to my liking but the seasoning was almost not there . i had to salt and pepper the heck out of it . hubby's patty melt came on rye bread . he felt that the meat had no seasoning what so ever . we had a nice lunch , but keep in mind this is a tavern so dont be shocked if the annoying dude at the bar keeps hollering at the game above the bar . or the loud overbearing people in the table near you have had to many beers at 1 in the afternoon . yes people we were annoyed but your obsurd behavior ! our server left something to be desired . i don't think he has waited on tables very much . we left him only a 10 tip which is more than i had wanted to leave . he was not attentive , he acted like it was a bother to come serve us . another server kept refilling our drinks . wish we could have given the tip to her . i think we may try this place again .
take out 2 22 15 started to use cardboard boxes for take out . price is $ 1 more than yonge and finch i always get 8 wings here and 9 10 at maple or yonge n finch plus phoned order in , 10 15 minutes quoted . i ended up waiting another 15 min in store , its like they didnt trust me or forgot . sad . down hill . let me know when they fix their actions
the food was good . but the customer service was very ummmmm strange . the waiter was nice , but we never saw him and when i did i had to ask for water , napkins , and everything else . i will probably be back because i love the hotel , but if my customer service is medeoker again imma act a forum and demand my food for free .
the best coffee in charlotte ! located in atherton mill , this coffee shop is by far my favorite . there is a great variety of coffee to choose from , however i recommend a pour over , it really captures the essence of the coffee . worth every penny !
my new favorite spot in old town ! will definitely be back and become a regular . so beautiful inside when you walk up those stairs . sat outside on the patio and it overlooked scottsdale rd . great hand crafted drinks that were paired with amazing food ! had the best service hands down . from the moment that we walked up to the hostess stand sydney sp was nice and showed us to a great table . loren came out and was so nice and personable explained the delicious menu ! nicole came to greet us and was warm and inviting . told us all the great things to eat and drink . ask for nicole , she's the best ! loved tracy and her accent ! we both have a love for champagne . met tommy and he was so nice . don , his father , constructed a beautiful place ! i'm completely smitten with this place . definitely my go to place , from here on out ! definitely telling everyone about this fabulous place !
love this place ! one of the best tamales i've ever had . same goes for the chile relleno . delicious food all around . the salsa is different than most . dark and smokier . the margaritas get an a in my book , also ! service is always good and fast . i wish it was closer to my house !
being new to the area we decided to give gordas a try . the whole family was glad we did . i ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas . both were delicious . i especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious . my husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing i had ordered one myself even if they were big lunch for the next day . my daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans . there were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated . i only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer . we will definitely be back though the food was that good .
my wife and i recently had dinner at brewers at 4001 yancey . we started out with the citrus gin cured salmon , which took quite a bit of time for them to bring out which was surprising since i don't really think the prep time would be all that long . it was good , but pretty run of the mill for salmon and capers on a crusitini . for the main course , my wife and i both ordered the brewhouse burger . she asked for hers to be medium . i'm an aristocrat , so i asked for medium rare . per usual for burger places , both came out pretty medium . both were good , but like the app , not great . overall , the food was decent and the beer is good . this would be a good place for a big group of people since it's massive , or just a good place to drink .
have been here often but last time was about a year ago and have not gone back because food was average and cost was silly . went back 2 weeks ago . likely won't be back . lots of waitstaff buzzing around but busy chatting amongst themselves and not really paying attention to tables . wine was delivered fast yay food was just average tasting chicken artichoke dish and chicken parmagian had to ask for basil . oye it's an italian restaurant no ? one waiter took my knife and i could not get the attention of our waiter and ended up reaching across to another empty table and grabbing one because after 10 minutes of getting our food our waiter never showed up to ask how anything was . our waiter showed up near the end with the check without asking us if we wanted dessert . we ordered gelato . it was the best thing we had .
i didn't think it was possible for a starbucks location to make me so angry . horrible service . please , please , please do not go to this starbucks ! there are many other locations throughout the strip , so do not waste you're time at this grouchy location . i came here to order a venti peach black tea for my mom and a grande iced water with two scoops of matcha for myself . first off , the cashier girl tania doesn't smile at all when greeting customers . when i order the drink she doesn't really listen . she had to ask what i ordered after i finished ordering . when i ordered my drink she said that they don't do that anymore . i asked if i could just buy the matcha and water and she rudely said no . she asked if i wanted to get something else and i said no and another worker who was standing by her said that they were running really low on matcha powder . so , there was matcha powder available , but i couldn't have any because i didn't order one of their expensive drinks . i am lactose intolerant so i didn't really want to buy a green tea frap , but still wanted matcha . instead of suggesting something else for me she just happily talks to coworkers and then once again rudely turns back to me and asks what my name is with a scowl on her face . i guess it sounded like i said aylen ? even if you don't want to give customers iced water with scoops of your matcha powder , you could at least say it nicely . i totally would not care if i was just told that it was their store policy to not serve that , but i just can't believe that starbucks would hire such unpleasant workers for a customer service position . when you wait for your drink just keep an eye out , because they will not call out your drink or name written on the cup .
this is my go to car wash . it is conveniently located on 3rd street , at the intersection with charlottetowne ave . is it more expensive than a drive thru ? it can be , but with a $ 4 ride thru only option , it can also be cheaper . however , i do like the fact this is one of the few places your can get a vacuum and hand dry done in a speedy fashion . i also like the fact they do real tire dressing and will walk around the car with you to make sure it's all good before you drive away . can you spend a bundle on all of that ? sure , but you can always option this out to a price point that fits your budget . you've got to admire a place where the workers hustle about running from one job to the next , but will still take the time with you to make sure the job is done right . do make sure to tip these guys remember you can buy a tip card with your credit card at the point of purchase too !
i'm not really big into ice cream on account of it being unhealthy and contain lactose , but i like it . i've been taken here a couple of times to get ice cream and though i had never heard of this place before , it is immediately apparent that it is just like cold stone creamery that i'm familiar with , but not quite as good . i say this because the people working don't seem to be as interested in helping customers with creating great flavor combination or recommendations things i've come to expect from my cold stone experiences and would be appropriate considering the nature of the store . friendly enough , but not informed or helpful . the quality of ice cream and toppings also don't seem to be as good , but still good enough to get your ice cream fix satisfied . it's pretty good ice cream and they have lots of flavors including my favorite peanut butter that are hard to find elsewhere . the topping selection is a little above average , and they have hot fudge . so all considered it's a pretty good ice cream shop . i've been to several better shops , but no others in toronto so i don't know how it compares around here . i can tell you that it's quite expensive for what you get in quantity , quality , and service . in line with toronto's general mantra of pay more , get less .
my husband and i went there today . we ordered panipuri and masala dosa . the pani puru was bot what i has expected at all . we were both dissapointed but then again we are bengali , i guess punjabis make it differently . the dosa was , as my husband says 'el perfecto' . the restaurant has a nice ambience and we both loved that they serve water in a very old timey looking brass jug and goblet . the other items were resonably priced . would go there again .
zero stars ! 1st needed a new hot water tank , enercare sent a third company to install , as they took out old one they hit my wall causing all my picture frame to fall and shatter . enercare not taking responsibility for their contractors and showed no help to get the contractor to reimburse . i have called countless time with the run around and no call back . 2nd booked a service call waited over a month to have the person not show up . when i called to ask what happened they said it was too cold to perform the work . it was 18c and sunny . no call to cancel the appointment just didn't show up . customer service is horrible . they do not value your business . do not use this company !
if you aren't wearing toms , skinny jeans , and those large hipster glasses , do yourself a favor and don't come here . and that applies to the guys as well as the girls . older 30ish crowd , pricey beers , rude staff , bartenders who don't know the beer , gross bathroom , massive amounts of hipster hippie pretension . when the door guy is mean to you because you smiled . you know you're in the wrong place . i've heard the happy hour is good , but i will never try it . yes it's free of college kids , but when the alternative to that is a bunch of older judgmental people trying to be scene , i'd rather hit up great dane or one of the other places with a friendlier crowd and better beer specials . try king mane .
i always dread buying a car through a dealership , but wow was i ever surprised by this place . we had so far been through the high pressure tactics of every dealership in the avondale automall , and an experience with a less than honest craigslist seller , so by the time i got to thrifty , i was pretty exhausted i only had 3 days to find a car . i found a spotless 2005 volvo v70 station wagon within minutes of entering the lot . took a test drive around the block with anthony , the sales guy , and knew within minutes that i just had to have this car . at no point did i experience any high pressure tactics . the entire sales experience went unbelievably smoothly , and the dealership took care of the registration , insurance , the works and i really do love my new car . its been an excellent ride so far , and was very well taken care of by the previous owners . the car was fully certified , as are all the other cars on the lot . the only reason i am not giving 5 stars was that they did all the insurance , without informing me of all my insurance coverage options . when i looked closer at the policy , i was disappointed to find that i would have been close to underinsured . so i was glad i read the fine print . i ended up having to void that policy and start from scratch at the insurance office to make sure i found a package that would cover me better . would still highly recommend this place though !
love it ! they are fast , friendly and the food is fantastic .
very dissatisfied about its food . i asked chicken marsala , not flavor ! the lasagna and meatballs too . it's priced high for the quality of food . the location and ambience keep us there . but i would not recommended
andrew's is the best ! we called them at 5 00p . m . they were here at 8 30p . m . they have great employees their pricing is fair . they didn't try to rip us off . we will always use andrew's refrigeration .
this place is great . not touched from the 70's , dimly lit , carpet floor . yes carpet floor . soft clean carpet . drinks are good food is good also . tried the wings , fries , and 2 types of burger . had the 5 . 95 burger with cheese , asked for medium rare came out medium . no biggie . lacked a bit of flavor but good . pickle was great to . then tried the texas cheeseburger . this thing was good . pay the extra $ 1 and get this thing well worth it . can't go wrong here and probably one of the friendliest bars i have found . service is outstanding and we were lucky enough to be there on vintage vegas night where they had a band that played some great music . i will visit this joint every time i am in vegas now to take a trip back into the 70's .
1st time here . loved it ! tofu tom kha soup is flavorful and delicious . chinese broccoli with crispy pork also very good . i'm a small person so did not have room for dessert , will try it next time . servers very attentive and did not disappoint . packed up my leftover instead of just bringing out boxes and letting me do it myself like so many other asian restaurants . when i walked in i was a bit weary of this place . it's small , casual looking and located in a not so fancy area . but the food and service made me quickly decided i will be back again . tips . check into yelp for free thai t
the first time i went there , all i had was won ton soup and i didn't think much of it . but then my boyfriend and i went back one day for general tso chicken , and it was incredible . we order out from here at least once a week bi weekly . it doesn't hurt that they're located on the main strip of bellevue , and their staff are super friendly . best chinese food in bellevue !
we love this place ! i had some delicious pot pie and cabo chicken . so nice to eat here . quality people and quality food .
in case you're looking at this on 4 06 2012 i forgot i needed to update this because there is a change in management at bee gee's . yakitori is now limited to chicken thigh , heart , wings , fish balls , and squid balls . items are mostly hibachi style hot plate , but have no worries they still make their tasty drinks !
i really miss going here to get my nails done . i decided to go natural with my nails , but miss the wonderful customer service and quality nails . this place is a wonderful place to get your nails done . they would always listen to all of my crazy designs and i even got my hubby in there for a pedicure
this place is so close to work , i just had to give it a try . so i got assorted pastries , and they were handing out samples , so i tried that as well , i believed it was gluten free bread , it taste ok , then i asked the ingredients they use , one of the first thing she said was canola oil . that was a huge no no to me , they used trans fat to make their pastries ! ? no wonder their pastries has this phyllo texture ! do not recommend to anyone that cares about their health and their family's .
chase is all about money . i have banked with them since it was washington mutual . i never had any problems with washington mutual . i am not a big depositor with chase and i do incur overdraft fees from time to time . it's one thing to charge overdraft fees , but to then charge fees on the overdraft fees i think it akin to extortion . chase does not care about you as a person . we are only numbers in their ledgers . all of these banks would do well to realize that if it wasn't for customers like us , they would not have those high paying jobs . are financial institutions so desperate for money they will do whatever they can get away with to get more of it ? shameful
i agree with the above and beyond . co owner amber has been doing my hair for the last 5 years , so ace's is the only place my entire family and i will go ! they do amazing cuts , colors , and anything else you could want with a keen eye for detail , a sense of style , and friendly atmosphere . no need for redos and or oopsies , but they can take care of you should that tragedy befall you at some other salon ! the pricing is very reasonable and is always worth it . there's never a really long wait but i recommend calling to make an appointment or to see if they're busy . many kudos to them bc i've gotten compliments time and again from hair dressers stylists from aveda , dolce , madison 5th ave , paul mitchell , and toni guy , and i did not pay anywhere near the price you would pay at those places !
decided to try this restaurant out after hearing such amazing reviews and seeing the incredibly long lineup on weekends . it was a friday at 10 30am and the restaurant was still completely full do torontonians not have jobs ? ! we ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict and the bacon , avocado and brie eggs benny . the english muffin on both was nicely toasted with just the right amount of crunch and egg whites cooked through with yolk running perfectly . i'm not quite sure how they made the hollandaise sauce but the first bite was heavenly , almost tasted like a very buttery sour cream and had a smooth consistency . the pulled pork was a little bit dry but it may have been because it wasn't smothered in bbq sauce . the flavours all in all went pretty well together . the side salad they served was delicious with an asian inspired miso soy dressing . the only downfall was the service was pretty average , with little to no contact from the servers . they forgot our juice and coffee order and brought it whe we were basically done our food . when we finished they asked if we would like anything else and we said no so they quickly brought us our bill . i felt a bit rushed out , the restaurant was emptying out and there wasn't much need for that push to pay since we did just receive a full glass of juice we had to drink which they forgot to bring . they did take it off the bill , however soon after we were told it was a cash only restaurant and we had to go find an atm machine . this is something that should be mentioned up front or written in more plain view , instead it was in small letters on an open door that people were standing in front of and we couldn't see it . we then had to pay a $ 5 atm fee . not impressed at all . all in all it was pretty good , but not a restaurant i would rave to come back to . it was just a more complex and refined greasy spoon . and the service was just awful . if the food wasn't so good i would have given the restaurant a 1 star .
don't go there . we called ahead made 2 appointments for our kids waited 20 min after our time . they let people with out a appointment go ahead .
have to agree with jennifer k . the pork bone soup was a lot less spicy and flavour was a bit lacking compared to other korean restaurants . still a very good soup though . huge portions of meat but almost to the point that i could not finish it . at $ 9 . 99 its a bit higher in price when you can find lunch specials for the same quality at $ 6 . 99 . also got the soon tofu with yellow tail for $ 15 . 99 . the fish itself was quiety large and grilled very nicely which made the skin of the fish very crispy . side dishes included sweet and sour radish , kimchi , bean sprouts , peanuts and a pickled veggie . not my most favourite side dishes . the service was excellent . waitress asked twice if we wanted extra side dishes .
i'm sure that not everyone will have this experience but tonight i am alone in a hotel in wisconsin in food poisoning agony due to this food . not recommended .
carnitas tacos all the way ! if i didn't listen to my belly , i could easily kill 10 of these suckers . so i stopped at 6 , and surprisingly , did not feel gross afterwards . that's a 5 stars review in my neck of the woods . don't be fooled by the exterior , the bars aren't meant to keep you out , it's to protect you when you're inside . i've never felt so safe , watching telemundo music videos , eating tacos , and hanging out with my buds .
my absolute go to bubble tea spot . they were the first , and they are the best . variety of flavors and sizes , and the tapioca pearls are soft but not mushy . just the right amount of bounce ! they do not have the tendency to be occasionally hard and undercooked like other tea places . i usually get the jasmine green tea , no milk , with tapioca . it isn't as sweet as some of the flavored teas and there is a fresh jasmine tea flavor . flavored milk teas are excellent but more like a dessert drink than an iced tea . i was waiting until i tried their food to review them , and that was fantastic too ! i ordered the tofu with chinese pepper . had a really wonderful taste ! not too oily or too spicy . perfectly seasoned . tofu was chewy with crunchy exterior . it was really excellent . i can't wait to try more food from here !
this place has everything you need for any small appliances including air conditioning motors . the owner is very nice and helpful . i look forward to buy more parts from
not a full dd . avoid i have been here twice getting my car washed and while dunkin donuts has a pretty safe floor , the manager here seems to have a real problem with stocking . both times i've been here i ordered my favorite sandwich which comes on a french roll and both times they were out of french rolls . ok , fine . give it to me on a plain bagel . but wait , they're out of plain bagels too ! both times ! i get that in the large scheme of things this is really a minor problem , and the food was still pretty good . it is what it is , but as far as dd's go , this one is pretty weak .
durant's is classic phoenix and i am a fan of classic phoenix . i love that it's been there forever since 1950 , to be exact . i love that you enter through the kitchen if you know what's up . i love the steaks , the martinis , the manhattan clam chowder , and the oysters . i love the service by a waitstaff that has worked there for 20 years they are on top of your order , attentive not obtrusive , and very knowledgeable about the menu . i love the old time decor feeling dark wood and red banquettes . i do not love the high prices , but i am not surprised by them . however , if you order smartly , you can easily keep your meal under $ 40 . open note to durant's management can you please get some new booths in there ? the existing ones are old and saggy .
elite kitchen concepts designed and installed kitchen cabinets for both of our office spaces . both kitchens turned out exceptionally beautiful ! from the beginning of the projects until the end , marco and ryan were very responsive , professional and skilled . they are incredibly good at what they do and i highly recommend them !
the great 1 . the beer . in a growing beer market , brixx has done a great job of offering locally brewed as well as other crafts to please a serious and or casual beer drinker . the weekly specials are great too there seems to be a deal on beer almost daily . 2 . service . super friendly server named kris friendly and knowledgable . the good 1 . the pizza . i like interesting non tradtional pizzas , so the menu is up my alley . ordered the thai chicken pizza while it was tasty , there is no way i could have deciphered that it was thai inspired if i didn't know . 2 . pear arugla salad . our great server kris , spilt the salad for us , so that was awesome . the salad was good , but missing pears . they are not in season , makes sense , but then take it off the menu . 3 . i arrived before 6pm , so happy hour specials half price appetizers were still going . i felt compelled to capitalize on the deal , but nothing about the apps stood out to me . ended up ordering the hummus trio . black bean variety was great , but the traditional and the roasted red pepper , weren't anything special and we barely put a dent in those 2 . overall , the experience was pleasant . the pizza is not my favorite in town , but its good enough for me to return for the great beer and fast and friendly service .
alyssa and her staff are very helpful every time my wife and i go over for shopping , the store has a variety of mk collections and the quality and styles are generally better than most of other competing brands . i look forward to the new men's store that is opening soon !
this place is the best . i can't go to vegas with out stopping here and grabbing a carne asada burrito . the best part is that they're open 24 hours with a drive thru .
just walked past and they're closed . looks like they are out of business and not coming back . just fyi
leaning towards 4 . 5 on this one . the drinks are good , strong , and reasonably priced for what amounts to 3 oz of hard liquor . the food is probably the best bar food in town , and oddly cheap considering the quality . however , i recommend avoiding late nights and weekends . the music gets a bit loud and house y for my tastes , and it can be so crowded you can't move . obviously there are people who like that , but i much prefer to go for dinner and a drink right after work .
i can count on crown trophy to make medals and plaques for my school awards . they have a large selection of styles and price ranges .
i love this church ! the bible is taught faithfully , all are welcomed , flip flops are fine and the music rocks ! i have two small kids 6 and 3 and the kids program is fantastic as well . my kids won't ever let me skip church !
pretty horrible . operates similar to fuddruckers . burgers were comparable to fast food and the nothing was fresh in the condiments bar . soggy lettuce and cucumbers .
stopped by and tried out the chocolate vanilla nice flavor . the inside is pretty basic plain , you wouldn't want to spend much time here . two tiny tables inside that will seat a combined total of 4 , some chairs outside , but it was way too hot . good spot if you live in the building , but i wouldn't go out of my way again to come .
who is to say if this worked or it didn't . i feel like i wasted 125 on a groupon to try it out . they start out by saying most people don't see any results in 3 session . oh great that is what i have is three sessions . what a waste . the staff though friendly don't seem so professional . two occasion waiting in the waiting room for 5 to 10 minutes before noticed . the other a teen ager was acting as the receptionist . if i had it to do again i wouldn't . i really wish i would have know no what i didn't know when i bought the groupon .
love their shrimp and grits ! ahmed is an amazing server . he was helpful with suggestions for food and drinks . we have eaten here several times and the food has never disappointed . best drink with carrot juice and tequila ! there is a dessert they need to put in the menu , permanently . the ricotta pound cake with strawberries , balsamic , mascarpone , and basil . amazing !
called 5 nearest places near me 89074 to fix a cracand this spot was as much as $ 30 cheaper than the rest . they gentlemen inside were courteous . the phone was ready in about an hour . i'll return again .
justin was our dealer and jeremy was our finance agent they added a lot of hidden fees that was not disclosed to us at all . we found out later when we already have signed the contract . they added 7k on top of msrp . we we're able to haggle 2k off when we returned but still i felt like i was robbed so beware of this dealership .
1st visit even seeing the lower rating for this location , i decided to stop in for after work take out food . they weren't busy at all , i suppose it is because they are still new and possibly unknown . but , it's nice to see new restaurants in this area they are desperately needed ! took a second to browse the menu and placed my pick 2 order . i'm also a reward member and had a free pastry reward so i picked the chocolate chipper cookie by far one of the best cookies i have eaten . half green goddess cobb salad w grilled chicken very fresh and delicious . half i already forgot the sandwich very fresh and delicious . after to go order you head towards the back of the restaurant to wait by the server to go window and there is a monitor with the list of patrons in line . even with three in front of me , it went pretty fast . on the way out i stopped to purchase a cinnamon roll for the next morning and the nice young lady just handed me one and said have a great night ! wow . i'll definitely be back , especially to check out panera breakfast . who knew they had breakfast ? 2nd visit so , i finally stopped in for breakfast . wanting something other than a pastry , i decided on a healthy turkey sausage , egg white , spinach and cheese sandwich . as well as a large iced coffee . service was fine , employees were friendly . but boy am i disappointed in this sandwich . there was no disclaimer that it was a turkey sausage patty but instead , turkey sausage crumbles inside the egg white . what ! ? don't quite get that would've liked a warning so i could definitely not order it . in the end , i didn't end up eating most of it . what a waste of five dollars ! it wasn't until i got to work , opened the sandwich and asked wheres the turkey sausage patty ? i searched the pb website only to reveal the meat on this sammie is blended into the egg whites . nooooo ! it must be a pattyyyy ! come on panera ! sadface the iced coffee was ok . it was self serve . the end .
i cannot believe how rude the manager mani was being after i had just purchased a car from them i had a couple questions to ask him in regards to the car . don't get me wrong i love the car but it's unbelievable how shitty they treat you after you buy . he treated me like crap and was being a smart ass the whole time . i will never refer someone here or buy another car . so rude i can't even believe it .
decent little esoteric bakery in cabbagetown . no much to write home about in terms of decor but really good cookies ! i will write another review when i try more of their treats .
so glad this place opened down the street . so fast and so yum ! if you're looking for good pizza that's fast and easy , blaze is the place . impressed !
so i found this place on a whim , i actually went into yelp to pull up the number for sears to call and get a quote for some service recommended by the honda dealer and after trying to exit sears a list of recommended places that provide quotes within 24 hours popped up . this was my first time seeing something like this and boy am i appreciative . sun city was one of the 5 options in which i messaged 3 of the 5 and received a response from all 3 however the hours and availability as well as the reviews related to sun is the reason i choose to proceed with sun city . this place is nestled up a little rocky hill and can easily be mistaken for a small tow yard or parking if driving too fast . i called and schedule an appointment for a free diagnosis and upon arriving i was greeted by sandy who was pleasant and handed me a form to complete as a newbie . i checked in on yelp and showed sandy and received my coffee cup tea cup in my case as i don't drink coffee . the waiting area is small with 4 seats and a television , i was lucky to be there when i was as i had the second seat . chuck took me out to show me under the car and explain what i needed and he was so thorough to even out the items in order of importance in the chance that the cost was out of budget . i actually decided to get everything done as the total for it all plus several extra things was still 1 4 of the cost provided by the dealer with labor . we were leaving town the next day and chuck allowed us to leave the car over the weekend and once we picked it up monday it drove like the day i drove it off the lot new . i am so extremely thankful and appreciative . all car services for my teenagers cars will be done at sun city no doubt , they now have a new loyal customer .
the large poki bowl is enough for two . we like the choices here . there are a lot of items i usually add everything to my bowl because i like there to be a lot of vegetables . you can choose white rice , brown rice , sushi rice , or green salad . i got a mixture of two . the staff is very nice and friendly . they have a stamp cart buy 10 earn one free . the portuguese soup is really tasty . so far there's plenty of parking . the only issue is the traffic getting back onto maryland parkway . other than that i love everything about it . i've been there twice before . it's right next door to aloha kitchen in the same parking lot as smashburger and firehouse subs . it's better than most of the poki places i've tried more of a mom and pop shop than a corporate chain .
i have been to many afghan restaurants in the bay area and have often been disappointed when i goto new restaurants with afghan cuisine . i really enjoy afghan food and found this place to be of very good quality and i thought the environment was very pleasant and the food was very tasty .
i ordered the chicken n waffles and a side of mac n cheese . the chicken n waffles were pretty good it came with a bacon type and i didn't care for that , but everything else was amaze balls ! the mac n cheese was a tab bit disappointing because they referred to it as baked mac n cheese and indeed did not taste like a baked mac n cheese . but vegan mac n cheese is hard ! the place is cool ! the menu is huge and will def be going back to try other stuff !
super cute coffee shop downtown , with access to an art gallery , and little plant shop . there is seating inside and outside . you do have to order at the front . the only part is that when you walk in , the be coffee is straight ahead and there is a restaurant to your right . which is a little disorienting . staff is wonderful !
great food , a little overpriced . only giving this place 3 stars because even if they don't take reservations on the weekend . my party of 11 was even 30 minutes early and we even still had to wait 45 minutes after the time we were all supposed to meet . the hostesses did not do much to help .
so i'm writing this review after sitting here for 30 minutes with a menu in front of me and no one has bothered to even take our drink order . we are in plain site but no one even came to check on us . they are not even busy at all . several people came after us and got service but they ignored us probably because we weren't a big party . so after having time to consider their overpriced food i will go somewhere else and actively tell people not to go here . before leaving i went in and told the wait staff we would be leaving because we didn't receive any service and they were hardly even concerned read rude . at least i got to eat a basket of their gross greasy chips for free . we won't be back here or to their equally overpriced and meagerly less than average sister restaurant john cutter . if you want overpriced greasy bar food don't miss john cutter !
they truly care about my comfort level and that i'm very informed about what they are doing . everyone is friendly and very helpful . best dental experiences there i've ever had !
we happened to be across the street and saw u swirl so decided to stop in . we saw the flavors offered on the menu and grabbed our cups . a couple of the machines were broken and from reading other reviews this seems to be an on going problem . we also noticed that several of the flavors on the menu were different than those actually offered . another issue is that some of the flavors were coming out really soft and melted . they have plenty of seating and parking was plentiful in the private lot . this place was disappointing and has nothing on yogurtland . definitely worth a drive down eastern to find better frozen yogurt .
this lowe's is only a mile plus from my house . i come hear a few times a week on average and have never been disappointed . it is not as busy as some of the other lowe's i've been in and the service is always very good and personable . i used to go to the other home improvement store that won't be named here but uses a lot of orange on their sign . i could never get decent service there and am happy this lowe's was built a few years back . their return policy is pretty generous and i've never had an issue returning anything . my wife and i purchased all of our replacement appliances there and joe in the appliance section when out of his way to assist us . they also offer a 30 day in home guarantee on appliances . we ended up not liking the oven and they let us exchange it and pay the difference for a different one . they also give a military discount everyday and it includes retirees . this lowe's feels like a local hardware store and not a huge warehouse store .
we had a company outing here and it was perfect . the food they made was delicious . attentive bar service too . it was awesome being in a non smoking venue in vegas .
we ordered the gyro special for pickup , which came with fries . until pickup , when they tried to charge us for the fries again , saying that they were already paying a 15 percent commission to yelp's eat24 , so they couldn't actually afford to do the special . i wish i could say that the gyro was worth the trouble , or even decent , but it was meh .
totally love this place . they have great deals on a lot of used cds , dvds , and even video games as well .
i went in last week and it was my first time trying mediterranean food and i absolutely loved it ! i had the beets salad and it tasted incredible . the cashier was the young lady with long hair she was great , very accommodating and she let us sample different salads . the environment in the store also made me feel very welcome . my experience was great overall , especially the service .
i absolutely love this place ! perfectly clean and everything is sterilized or brand new , even the emery boards . you'll want to make an appointment , but it is worth planning ahead .
i was excited to know about the presence of an indian restaurant right on the strip , and we were happy to shell out 40 bucks including tax for a dinner buffet for two of us which is highest that i have paid for an indian buffet ! the experience turned out to be just okay . the quality of food was not bad . in fact , the naan and gulab jamun dessert were excellent , and most of the other items , except idlis and sambhar were also okay not great . idlis were certainly stale by at least a day ! i have more problem with the variety aspect of the buffet . i have seen more variety in $ 10 buffets ! the number of vegetarian entrees especially was limited . how can any indian buffet be complete without a single paneer entree ? and really , zucchini as an entree in an indian buffet ! ? o also , i would expect more starters than just pakodas and at least , a complimentary chai in a $ 20 buffet ! chai was $ 2 , and wasn't good ! next time , if you are on the strip and you crave for indian food , take the deuce to indian masala ! you can thank me by a useful vote here later !
the food at olives is not as good as you'd expect for the price tag , but it receives 3 stars from me for the extras . first , the bread basket is totally yummy . there's a variety of breads to keep you happy while you wait for your meal , and each one was good . second , the atmosphere is quite nice . it's upscale ish without falling all over itself . third , we were given a stellar table for a reservation made 2 hours in advance , for 12 people , on a busy saturday night . the food is oversalted and under tasty . we were all happy enough with our meals , as it tasted good , but nothing about it made us feel like food is the focus at olives . i think they are banking on the location inside bellagio and the atmosphere to be the draw , and serving good but not great food .
first time trying this place , 1 . dr pepper tasted like root beer they say it's not 2 . no soup with the special 3 . kung pao chicken bland asked for mild 3 but it was more like 7 4 . wonton was basically a chip overall the food was less than average and the service about the same
the food is okay . just an ordinary sushi place in the mall complex . the live shrimp was good . the home made wasabi that cost $ 7 extra was not worth it . too much filler with little horse radish or whatever they used to make it with . uni dish . they say the uni is live uni . but it was not fresh enough not creamy enough . personally , i think the uni was dead when showing . the rice below the uni was mixed with seaweed that was over cooked . not fresh . soft shell crab was okay . the crab was okay but the coating was awful . too much of the breading that i could barely taste the crab itself . most importantly , the sashimi was not cut right and it had too much lemon taste to it too . it is bazzar that they put lemon before serving . i dont put lemon on my sashimi because the acidity ruins the taste . i only put lemon on when the fish is not fresh . overall , the taste of the food was not balanced . i gave 2 stars because of the kindness of the servers not for the food . if you are seeking authentic japanese food , do not go here . definitely not worth the detour for this kind of food .
outstanding food , most of the time at least , but the service at this arrowhead location is terrible . as other reviewers have noted numerous times , service at this location is inexplicably slow . i have been there when it was packed , empty and everything in between . i have been there with my wife , my family members , with work for team and group events , you name it , and the service has always been poor . more recently , i have found that even when the place is nearly empty and there are more wait staff than diners , you still cannot get timely service . it seems to always be friendly service , as others have pointed out , just extremely slow . on our last visit , my wife and i sat ignored in a booth for over fifteen minutes , arms folded in front of empty plates , waiting for a check since a refill never came and nobody checked on us after the food came out . i took this to the management and spoke with them for probably the third or fourth time about their service problem and also sent a lengthy email to the owners as well , describing my service experience and the consistent pattern of bad service and no apology at this particular location . the end result ? the owners never even responded to my email , despite numerous assurances from the manager that they would speak to me . as a result , i've decided to never patronize this location or any other dillon's ever again . i will sorely miss the food , as will my wife and our family , but i will not dine at an establishment where the owners give repeat customers who struggle to remain loyal the cold shoulder . customer service is clearly not a priority at dillon's and , judging by the owners' lack of response to a concerned customer , it obviously is a top down problem . i would avoid this place if you expect great service , because it has never been my experience and i doubt it ever will be when the management has this kind of attitude towards customer service .
best savory vegan breakfast in town . actually , best breakfast in the valley . french toast is incredible . egg omelette's are tasty with thought given to every ingredient . the kale side is always a must .
came in from san diego and searched for a sports bar to watch first game of the mlb ww cubs lost . but , our win was to find this place ! great drinks , friendly staff , and great authentic regional mexican food . man , it was delicious ! happy to have spent the time and money there . we now love scottsdale ! ordered the tacos pibil and the no que no margaritas . the pibil is not common marinated pork with specific seasoning and care in cooking out of sight . the bartender is hip and a veteran of his craft . this place is legit and worth the visit !
two bucks has pretty good food and decent beer prices . it's one of those places that you'll go to anytime , but you won't go out of the way to stop there . small dining room bar area with a covered outdoor area . two bucks started as a very affordable place that kept prices to a minimum . they used to have really cheap food and beer and have worked to maintain that over the years . sliders are pretty good . mac and cheese is a small portion but offers a ton of add ons , which will make it pretty pricey to get what you want . they always have affordable beer and a good selection of craft beers . servers share tables and are always on the run , but stop in to check on you frequently . they deserve five stars for their speed and responsiveness . you are attended to without being rushed . they always have the game on and the atmosphere is very casual . don't come with great expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time .
i was a patient here from 2014 until june 2016 . i've had two of their three pelvic physiotherapists . front staff tends to be good , professional . my main issue involves how the company professes to offer quality patient care , but shows limited understanding when money is involved . this review is of my two experiences , only , with synergy . i stopped going in 2015 , when my first physiotherapist interrupted me and insisted that the best results can be had by weekly visits , and time commitments . i explained that i had a few young children at home , and she offered to let me bring my infants with me . nice effort , but not a reality . bottom line was that i could not afford the time to go as often as she expected , she was not interested in meeting me halfway , and frankly the costs kept adding up $ 140 for 60 min $ 85 for 30 min . i began to go again as of jan . 2016 , out of necessity . recently , i showed up a bit late for my short appointment . it was my worse mistake to date i mistakenly thought the appointment was for 9 30 , and not 9 a . m . they informed me that they would charge me $ 50 for being a no show . i explained that i did show , and that i always do . i just happened to be late today . receptionist said she'd get back . she did , and told me that the committee she spoke with would reduce it to half of my appointment value $ 42 . 50 . i'm not a flake who has ever made a habit of not showing up , so i didn't appreciate that they wouldn't make an exception . i feel like my value to synergy , when we come down to it , is measured in dollar signs . this is frustrating . i had hoped to find a physio office that would provide 'quality' care be fair and consider their patients' situations , case by case treat their patients like they are valued beyond their insurance money , and . money . i politely told the receptionist that i would be finding another physio business that will be a better match for me . too bad i was looking forward to my visit and getting somewhere after visiting there for months .
sometimes it is really hard to get a good cup of coffee in vegas . this place has good coffee . it opens up right to the casino and is right next to the guest rooms so you can people watch or take it back to your room . i also tried the chocolate croissant yum and the breakfast yogurt parfait which was huge and really good .
this place is absolutely delicious ! not only is the food amazing , the quality of the food is unbeatable . and in my opinion , the best cheese curds in madison ! get a half order , they're amazing ! the location is amazing . the restaurant has tons of windows and glass , and the seating outside is beautiful . i got the pork bibimbap which is a tad different from bibimbap i'm used to . the rice comes in blocks of crispy rice that is very dense . honestly , not my favorite , but the other ingredients were good ! my friend got the graze burger and loved it , though he said it wasn't worth the price . the fries are delicious and i definitely recommend them . another friend got the mac and cheese which was incredible . light , creamy , flavorful . service was great , food was amazing , menu had so many different choices . it's pricy , but worth it . definitely go here !
i really enjoyed this little dog bakery ! my wall e dog turned 5 and i wanted to get him something special . a friend suggested the canine cafe and they did not disappoint . they have cute little doggie cakes , cookies and other treats . they also sell toys , collars , clothes and food . they are a little expensive but for birthdays or special occasions , it's totally worth it !
$ 325 to plug a toilet drain . the guy was there 15 minutes and didn't even bother to clean up after himself . the initial visit was a high pressure sales job which is always so distasteful . won't use them again and wouldn't recommend .
this place was shady as hell , never before have i been to a place where they make you pay up front before they bring you your drink . not only was that bad enough , but the waitress we had couldn't properly explain what the cost of things were , and when you have a group of 11 people it makes it hard to figure out who has to throw in how much . not only that but the mixed drinks were terrible as well , everyone in our group who got one said that they were awful . two people got a pina colada , and they couldn't even finish them . i don't know how you mess up a pina colada , but apparently they can here .
pretty good . nostalgic environment and tasty food , but typical scottsdale overpricing .
these people will rip you off ! call anyone else but them ! my toilet was running so we called apple plumbing . they said it was a bad flapper and quoted a low price to fix . plumber was very , very rude and offensive . they ultimately charged me $ 160 ! a few weeks later a different toilet was having the same problem . i replaced it myself , cost $ 4 . 98 and took me less than 5 minutes to fix . i feel apple plumbing really took advantage of me . they act very dishonestly and i would not recommend them .
food is great ! service is fast and friendly . location is amazing . i had the baked brie as a starter , fish chips as my entree and an excellent cappuccino . ,
i wish i had come in sooner , i've been missing out ! the service was great , the owner was nice and even gave us an extra scoop of rice for my toddler . the portions are a good size and the meats are flavorful and tender . i felt like i was back home and my auntie and uncle were in the kitchen cooking . you can definitely feel the pride the family takes in caring for its customers . absolutely love this place !
this place is just fantastic . i went there with my boyfriend and some out of towners for dinner . we sat outside and the patio was just perfect . the service was good and the pizza was amazing . i had the roma pizza . minus of the anchovies of course . the mozzarella was fresh and the dough and sauce were freshly made . they also have a nice selection of wines and the server was very knowledgably about suggesting parings . the dessert , well let me say i am still drooling ! i had the dolce della casa , essentially it was a calzone filled with homemade nutella and topped with bananas , carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream . i have recommended grazie to several people and all have thanked me afterwards !
i've used this place for about 5 years and they treat people fairly . i watched a crazy , irrational customer accuse the shop of wrongdoings and the desk guy calmly explained that the reciept did not list the same parts nor vehicle . as a female , it's hard to trust mechanics , but this place has earned my trust . they helped me get my dealer to honor a warranty . i had a bad water pump and it was eventually covered by the manufacturer . they explain when i ask questions . he even brought me to the car and showed me what he was doing . this was important because i have some car knowledge and i was having a trust issue so he showed me what he wanted to do . they quote time quite accurately . if it's going to take 3 hours for an oil change , he says that so i can choose to come back another day . i feel valued when i visit . this is my garage for oil changes and repairs . they once told me , it's not about today's deal , your car repairs this time . i want to treat you right so you come back again and again . sadly , i don't know this mechanic's name
my family and i have been seeing stephanie for over 20 years . not only is she an amazing person she is so good at what she does healing people ! there have been many times she comes in early to help me or others when they hurt their neck or back . she's trustworthy and will correct any pain you have . i've been her patient since i was 10 years old and seeing stephanie always puts my body posture back in alignment . thank you ! look no further for your chiropractor
beautiful people and beautiful work ! i have been going to the camelback location for over 12 years now . everything i have taken there has turned out fabulous . i've had watches repaired and batteries replaced , i've had necklaces , earrings , and bracelets clasps and stones fixed , and most recently had my wedding ring and a diamond bracelet rhodium finished and polished and a loose stone fixed in my favorite earrings . raul does the most magnificent work and everything he works on is done to perfection . my wedding ring looks like the day i got it 30 yrs ago . alicia is very thorough at writing your order and including every detail of each piece they work on and is a very sweet person besides . i would never consider going anywhere else .
i've used this ups store on multiple occasions for misc things shipping , copies , etc . and they have never let me down ! always courteous , quick , and reasonable . highly recommended !
been here twice for dinners . would definitely come back again . pros excellent food definitely better than average , and borderlining fantastic . great ambiance as mentioned by a previous reviewer , this location is quite beautiful as it is a renovated courthouse take beautiful into context though i'm not talking cathedral here , but it's a nice casual restaurant that's better than a typical moxie's . the lighting is low which is good , the bar at the front is nice and the dining rooms are quaint . regular priced food nothing too expensive , nothing too cheap service normal good but sometimes forgetful hipster esque as well cons it can be really loud terroni's , i find . i dined once in the regular dining area about 12 of us , so long table also downstairs in the cantina and both times , i found it unusually loud . i know this is a weird 'con' , and i wouldn't have mentioned it unless i found it unreasonably loud it made conversation a bit difficult , and something to consider if you're bringing someone here for a first date or something similar service can be a bit forgetful sometimes you ask for one thing , and you may have to ask again . food recommendations their pizzas esp . the classic margherita which is just mozzarella , sauce basil are excellent pastas are freshly made on site or so they claim and is delicious as well overall great place to go they do take reservations at this location for evening not at the queen st location 6 30pm and 8 30pm , so best to make reservations as they get busy .
hello there i have to tell my adventure in italian american restaurant social club , we have reserved for three people ! the service was good , but the food was horrible this is not an italian menu is a shame veal piccata was over cook the fish was smelly everything was disgusting ! i would not recommend to anyone and another thing the chef is not italian but mexican come on guys it should be . mexican american social club incredible
love this place . the options are great , they even have vegan meals , their margaritas are delicious also . if you're looking for a quite place this isn't it , but if you're looking for yummy food this is the spot .
i've went to a couple other bofa's in vegas and this is the only one i go to now . despite almost always being fairly busy , they work through long lines quickly and the wait is never what it would be at other places . i'm drawing a blank on their names , but the 2 guys that help with more complicated transactions are very very helpful and caring . when my father came and visited and got his card stolen , they were awesome in helping him work through it quickly and efficiently .
the lady was super nice but i won't be coming back . i mean just look at the pic really she could've actually cleaned the nail polish around the nails , they look terrible .
we love this restaurant in general and this particular store in particular . they are always friendly and helpful and the store is always clean . we visit often , worth the money . delicious food .
this place sucks . be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill . 40 bucks for dragon roll . come on . 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi . should have went to mandalay bay or luxor for some fine seafood .
i was unhappy about a service fee i had to pay but they made it right . we've been with them for a number of years and for the most part have been great to work with . overall i'm satisfied with their service and recommend them for a home warranty .
this place was so mediocre for the money spent . i needed a sweet pick me up and i was disappointed . i looked on yelp and saw the three stars , however , decided to give it a shot anyway . i purchased the crack pie milkquake since it's only made in vegas asked for suggestions beforehand , the girl at the counter wasn't too interested in helping me out in choosing something . so i kind of went with my gut . too sweet . not enough of a characteristic taste to make it stand out . there were like 4 globs of cookie and a bunch of soft serve . ummmm ok . lol . don't waste your money .
kinda obsessed with this place . in particular the beet salad . i crave it . i cant get myself to try other things because i know how good that salad it . i know from others about how good everything else is though ! i hear to try the protein bowls . the shakes are very good and good for you too . pricey though . everything here can be a bit costly especially if your just out on your lunch break . parking sucks . the outdoor area is nice except for people walking through on the sidewalk . i think this place is one of the best healthy eating options in the valley . enjoy !
this place is sooo good . it's tiny inside and the booths are cramped but wow for the price their food was killer . the best egg drop soup i've ever had , and if you order the 'a' dinner for four , you will get more food than you can eat . and my group of four was a group of four big dudes what can put food away . everything they served us was excellent . i've already been back for lunch .
one of two of my favorite sushi places located in the middle of the desert ! located on the west side , lahaina grill caters to the locals of summerlin and the surrounding area . the 24 hour sushi is no longer available but they do still serve it up until 4am . lots of special rolls to choose from on their menu . one of my favorites , the lahaina special of course . they also have a happy hour sushi menu that is quite an excellent value . the interior is unique in a good way with a tropical setting and the restaurant is clean . there is a full bar with video poker machines built in , a sushi bar no machines and plenty of table seating throughout . there's also a private room that can be reserved for meetings and parties that is sealed off with big windows and doors so you can be as loud and rowdy as you want without disturbing other patrons . i miss my old company's monthly meetings in there . i really enjoyed being able to order sushi at 9am on a weekday during a business meeting or rolling in at 3am after a night of partying craving sushi . well worth the drive to the west side if you happen to live east of the strip .
best bloody mary bar and breakfast ! i can see why it made the diners dives and drive ins show ! must go ! they even have a healthy menu for those who are on a health kick . along with everything else under the sun you could possibly crave for breakfast !
do not buy here ! very unethical business . they sell fake e . o and claim that they are therapeutic grade ! i bought some argan oil and it has a bad petroleum smell . i spent almost $ 150 there . all the oils i bought ended up in garbage !
fantastic little eatery . had the philly steak . veggies were cooked beautifully and the bbq sauce was spot on . well done sam ! mozzarella sticks where nice and crispy . clean and friendly environment . will be back with a hungry stomach !
located inside the venetian , this restaurant is one of the few that is open beyond 10 pm . the bread served here is amazingly soft and laden with garlic . we tried the eggplant ricotta pizza which was okay , nothing spectacular . the pesto gnocchi was good but had a slightly bitter aftertaste .
excellent food and friendly service . unique menu with a good variety . everything is prepared as ordered , so be prepared to wait a bit . located in cool , trendy neighborhood downtown . just go
spicy cucumber margerita just stole my heart . ordered a chicken taco , fish taco and street corn . everything was perfect and just out of this world except for the fish tacos which were pretty bland . our server was super amazing , he replaced the fish taco for a chicken one . all in all had an amazing time and the best food one can get in pittsburg . wish i could give it a 100 stars . looks like i ll have to have a permanent reservation here .
decent sushi at las vegas prices , but that fried chicken entree is pretty pretty pretty good . that really does about sum it up . located in the cosmopolitan , which is quickly becoming one of the stars on the las vegas strip , it's actually on the 3rd floor in what can be described as a small high end eating , drinking , and shopping mall . it didn't seem quite as popular as its next door neighbor jaleo , and they had plenty of seats available at the sushi counter where i sat . one entree , one roll , and a seaweed salad came out to be $ 60 . the roll and seaweed salad weren't very impressive , but the fried chicken entree was . i had seen other reviews raving about it , and add my name to the list of people who wouldn't mind eating it again . it was great piping hot when it came out to me , really crispy skin that had been doused with pepper and the honey like dipping sauce was good as well . though i enjoyed it more without the sauce . i will say that the entree was absolutely massive , and if you do order the fried chicken , try and share it with another person and or limit the number of other things you get . service was great , and i enjoyed sitting at the chef's counter they would occasionally well , once pass a complimentary tasting of something exciting that the chef had prepared .
went back to the griddle today for a quick power breakfast before starting the day . had the turkey sausage patties with 3 poached eggs , and wonderful sourdough bread . my girlfriend choose the sausage biscuit w gravy , poached eggs . everything came out prompt and tasted spectacular . it's been a while since my first visit to the griddle , but i must say that it beats the original sunrise cafe hands down , and makes the very top of my breakfast list for that area of town .
my dad and i went here yesterday , as we heard a lot of jersey mikes are very good . the decor is fine , although it is hard to see the menu unless you're almost first in line . i got a tuna on wheat with cheese and lettuce , which was surprisingly tasty . it came with chips i got sunchips garden salsa , a drink , and a cookie if you donated $ 0 . 50 to charity . that was a very nice touch , and several people did donate . the cookie was decent , it was a david's cookie . location is very good stonecrest , and service was personal and done with a smile . i would come back again .
i had incredibly slow service and never got checked on by the waitresses until i asked about my order after waiting about 30 minutes . at least 5 other bigger parties that arrived after me got their orders first and only after i asked about my order did it come out about 5 min later . i ordered the regular classic so it's the most simple one . not a big deal but it was a little offputting . the poutine itself was quite the experience . while the fries and gravy were delicious , i've learned that i can't handle that many cheese curds . i'm glad to say that i tried it though !
i really do like this place . i don't know why i don't come more often . today i tried shepherds pie . it was fantastic with chunks of ground beef plus mushrooms and peas and carrots in a gravy and topped with mashed potatoes . i also had a tj lemonade which was like a hard lemonade . pretty good too . our server was jalen and he was on top of things for our party of 10 .
if you're looking for fancy food , great service and ambiance , don't come here . however , the food is actually pretty good and authentic for northern chinese cuisine . i usually get takeout and it's a nice , simple , filling meal . the food tastes homemade which is a bonus for me .
i have been a server for about 5 years . garrison the mod , made mine and my girl friends dinner exceptional . i have never written a review before but i feel like people should know about his restaurants customer service , and excellent sushi . managers i have worked with do not usually go out of their way like he did for us . great customer service always makes the food taste better . the food was phenomenal . i was a little skeptical being from la county eating sushi in arizona but it was amazing . i would highly recommend this place . our manager , greeted us at the door and had a great attitude . give him a raise ! more restaurants should model his service ! thanks garrison !
rt's has great burgers . i keep getting the burger with the roast beef and sauerkraut on top . it's my third time there and third time ordering that exact meal ! they've got gluten free buns , which is awesome ! their regular fries are better than their waffle fries . they also have horse race betting . i'd never been to a bar where they did that before so it was pretty neat to see that . staff is super friendly and beer is cold !
i visited the shop today with my daughter . it was ok . we checked out the comforters only two that i saw . one was about 180 . the other one was not that much less in price . for quality , i think target , boston store , sears and jc penny's would be the route to go . the candles had a thin film coat of dust on them . when i see candles in stores and wonder if i should buy them , i give them a smell test . it was kinda weird seeing the dust on them for this reason . the sales people workers seem nice and professional .
i wish i could rate this place 0 stars and i did not even have an opportunity to try their product . i approached their stand at a street fair and watched them making liquid nitrogen desserts . the person in front of me asked for a flavor the same one i was going to order and the man made it , filled a heaping bowl of the dessert , and gave it to the customer . looked delicious . i order the same flavor . the man looks into the bowl and sees that there is not enough , and says i will make some fresh for you . good , that is the point of your whole gimmick , right ? he then looks around for things , looks up at the number of people , and begins scraping the bottom of the mixing bowl from the last batch . he takes out the mixer and scrapes it off , really pulling from the dregs . he then manages to fill the cup 3 4 which is maybe less than half of what he gave the person ahead of me and tries to hand it to me . while he was doing this i asked if he was going so still make it fresh , he ignored me . that's pretty lousy , but here is the bad part . he tried to push this yogurt on me and acted incredulous that i was not going to pay for that crap . i wasn't even going to take it from his hands . i had to suffer the embarrassment , in front of people i was wish , of this whole ordeal . buying frozen yogurt should not be so complicated . that behavior is unacceptable and rude , and so i recommend that people stay far away from these idiots . if this man was the owner , i hope they go bankrupt . boooo .
my classmates and i always come here after our exams about once a month . the bartenders are nice , and always serve us quickly . we ran into one of them at quinn's on st . patrick's day and he recognized us , which either means that we go here way too much or he has a fantastic memory . . maybe both . the spinach artichoke dip is remarkably delicious . sometimes we get coupons in the mail , which is nice . i had to dock two stars for the smell . i know this is vegas ish and people are still allowed to smoke inside , but they really need to get some fans or windows or new vents or something . i am definitely not a fan of the stifling stench of old cigarettes and the fact that my hair smells like cigarettes when i leave . everything else is dandy , though !
first the drink that they served to me through the drive thru had soda all over the sides and bubbling up through the lid . the cashier thought it was hilarious and told me to be careful . then she told me to go park and that it was going to be about 10 minutes . i said okay and please bring lots of hot sauce with my order . when the food finally came out exactly ten minutes later , there was no hot sauce , and they said why didn't you ask for any . once again terrible customer service !
although the alterations were good , i did experience a bit of frustration for my daughters wedding gown . when she went for her 2nd fitting , the top section was sagging of which their solution was to add elastic which also did not work . then when i went to pick the dress up after the steaming , their were stains on the trane that they did not take responsibility for . the only place my daughter tried the dress on was at dulce . then my dress was very uncomfortable at the neck line because of lace , their suggestion , use double sided tape . when i asked to have some fabric sown in to elevate the discomfort i was told that would not work . finally after much discussion she agrees to sew in a small piece that was not visible helped make the lace more comfortable . for the amount of money i spent to have these dresses taken care of , i would have expected a much better customer service .
best copy store in tempe ! okay , i might have worked for them for 3 . 5 years , but the people are awesome and prices are competitive .
always love myself some mcdonald's fries , but tonight they were horribly over cooked . i've never had this happen and now i'm kind of questioning life overall . first trump , and now over cooked fries !
we got two tower rooms connected to each other . the rooms themselves had a good amount of space and furnishings two armchairs . our rooms were clean and up scale looking and reminded me of smaller versions of the suite that we stayed in at the venetian hotel . beds and sheets were comfortable enough . while the walls and doors were thin enough to let noise come in , the halls and rooms were usually quiet . the marble bathrooms with granite counters gave the good sized bathrooms a luscious feel . the maids were very good about getting our rooms cleaned and the amenities stocked . the tower luxory rooms had many wonderful amenities that i don't see even in higher priced hotels . amenities included toothbrushes , toothpaste , mouth rinse , mineral baths , and lots more . the only problems were the loud fan in the room and the rooms themselves smelled heavily of cigarettes . however , i was overall very happy with these rooms for the low prices that i paid . i got these rooms as a package deal at travelocity . i would definitely return . however , i would never return to the buffet at this hotel read my review on their buffet .
this is authentic korean food just like halmoni used to make . skip the usual ayce korean bbq and try some home cooked food . their banchan is always changing and includes everything from kim chee to hot dogs with spicy peppers . the bulgogi and kalbi are both tasty , but their best dish is the spicy chucken chicken wings ! these wings are covered in a delicious sweet and spicy sauce and are super crispy . the bimbimbap has a great taste and makes you feel like your eating a nice healthy meal . also , they give you a giant bottle of hot sauce to spice it up . don't forget to wash down your tasty meal with a bottle or five of hite , one of my favorite lite beers !
my steak was alright . the salad bar was alright . service was alright . not much else to say . nothing stellar but it certainly wasn't bad . the price , however , was great . maybe i'd go back again but won't be running , especially since it is no longer around the corner .
stopped by the outlet to look and left with a bargain on a queen floor model mattress and adjustable base . i had a set budget for purchase and tom with his knowledge and patience with me trying many mattresses was a pleasure to work with , no upselling or high pressure . i can't wait for delivery , very excited ! thank you tom !
wonderful serve staff . hostess looks like they just broke up with boyfriends or someone passed in the family . foos is average bar food but this restaurant is definitely a leafs fan kind of restaurant . they prioritize leafs fans ! go to the bar for aktar hes very nice p
fun place to go to watch games ! esp sundays ! they have every football game ! my husband said they have the best wings he's had since moving to az . i had the cheeseburger , it was okay . i've had better . chicken fingers app is good too ! very helpful staff .
this was our first visit here tonight , my wife heard about rodizio and decided to give it a shot , we both went for the combination dinner salad bar and all the different meats you can eat , i'm thinking bring it on well that didn't last to long as after the first round i was stuffed everything was great as well as the service , i told my wife as we were leaving , i think this is the first time i couldn't eat my money's worth , we had a great time and sure we'll do it again soon .
i just ate at the views with my friends and it was awesome . the food was unique and delicious we even met the chef dustin as he was out talking to tables . there was just a warm feeling here i highly recommend .
service is always so great , prices are super reasonable and food is great . really nice vibe here ! always changing the menu , great to try new things !
amazing , perfectly cooked , juicy , tender , quality steaks ! i went here with a party of five to try out this new location . i didn't think this place would be that great and thought it would be comparable to like black angus or outback and let me tell you how wrong i was ! i'm pretty picky when it comes to steak , i don't like sawing off pieces of meat and i order my steaks medium rare and they never come out that way or it's just bleeding everywhere and still raw . we ordered the lobster stuffed filet and the ribeye and omg we were in heaven and could not believe how effortless it was to cut off a piece of steak and chew it . it melted in my mouth and was so flavorful and well seasoned . the service was great and attentive . i will most definitely come back again !
while wandering the vast vegas strip , my soon to be wife and i decided to eat here as not many restaurants are accessible right off the strip . we were not disappointed . the seats we got were not the best , but they did offer a good view of the packed restaurant . service was quick , and the meal was quicker . the pulled pork and ribs were extremely tender , and the variety of flavors quite evident . the beans were also bbq flavored , and a nice touch but my soon to be wife was not impressed with the expected results upon my ' iron stomach ' . i'd recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and bbq , and lots of it .
for the record i love white castle ! what i do not love about both locations in lv is the lack of parking . i literally drove to both of them and could not find parking in almost 10 blocks in any direction . i drove back to my hotel and called an uber just to get to wc . aside from the complete lack of parking they generated a standard product that was great as usual .
came into town for a game and decided to go to this place for dinner the night before . it was a little concerning when we walked up on a sunday night when there is football on and there were maybe 25 people there . once we sat down we were then only ones inside that's not a big deal though . we ordered a couple drinks and i ordered a beer off the menu that was hand written above the bar and they didn't have a few of the beers that were still listed so , i just asked what they had and got the first thing i recognized . after i finished my beer i ordered a mint julep . now being at a whiskey bar i figured this wasn't going to be a problem . but the waitress came back and told me they couldn't do a mint julep . a little shocked but i just asked for a jack daniels lynchburg lemonade . she couldn't do that either . so apparently they didn't have jack daniels lemonade and triple sec . asked her what whiskey coctails they had and apparently they only had one at the time . so i just ordered the same beer that i got because i knew they had it . ok so the food was good i ordered the parmesan encrusted chicken . nothing i would say was amazing but i left full . then we ordered desert and i wanted the brownie . but guess what they were out of that . the manager was great and bought us dessert . it looks like there's new management and they are still getting there stuff together . i'd give this place a few months before giving it a try .
my friend's love this place ! wonderful staff , very friendly and helpful . they have margaritas in all sizes . i'm a jumbo gal . good and somewhat strong . just keep stirring that drink till it tastes like kook aid . this will not be our last visit here . i'm pretty sure .
had the ribs . a bit dry and the sides were just okay . good selection on the menu and worth a look . price was mid range and there were no drink specials . nice atmosphere and friendly staff . overall it was a good meal .
being new to the area and trying to find a dog sitter was tough . i asked around and did some research on yelp and found pick of the litter . lisa and monica came over to meet with us and i felt that they were very proffesional and true doug lovers . monica stayed over night with our senior pit bull , tiko , while we were on vacation . she took the time to keep me posted and sent pictures , without me even having to ask . i had peace of mind knowing tiko was with a person who was taking good care of him and also understood house much his well being meant to us . i highly recommend pick of the litter !
excellent barbecue and very reasonable priced . we really enjoyed the ribs . they were tender and very tasty
yessss this place is great ! its like a vegas dive . definitely not fancy but its got everything you need for a great night in vegas gambling , cheap booze $ 2 beers $ 1 margaritas , karaoke ! this is a great place to play . but i don't recommend you stay . there is no way this hotel is nice .
this is by far one of the worse nail places in las vegas . they are wayyyy over priced and their customer service is very poor . they charge $ 50 for a acrylic gel fill and on top of that , they charge $ 5 extra dollars for color ? ! what the hell is wrong with these people ! they don't even do a great job at all ! do not waste your time coming here !
went here for a friend's party . while the place has nice ambiance , our waiter was attitude central and made it seem like he definitely did not want to be serving a party of 20 . he would avoid eye contact with us when we were trying to get his attention to order drinks . we would order , and it would take about 20 minutes to receive our pints . this would be understandable if it was jumping , but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant or outside . my roommate's latte arrived cold and he acted like he was doing her the biggest favor when she sent it back . she got another one quickly , this one scalding hot . nice one . another friend and i decided to order food , which arrived about 45 minutes after we ordered it . my poutine was cold , the gravy congealed , and there was maybe one cheese curd in it . my friend's chicken wings tasted like fish and chips . when we got the bill , he didn't bother to include gratuity in a party of twenty . he also tried charging two of my friends extra drinks they didn't order , and tried to charge me for the beer i ordered , but he messed up brought me the wrong one . i'd perhaps give this place another go it i was down in the area , as it could very well be that it was just this waiter's attitude that ruined it for me , but i will definitely not be making any special trips to the boiler house any time soon .
what a fun activity to do ! we did the wild west themed on . it was certainly challenging and you need every minute of the 60 allotted to complete the challenge . we managed to solve the puzzle with 7 minutes to spare and without assistance from the guide supposedly around 15 of the groups achieve this . i would say that the perfect size group would probably be 4 for this activity . anymore than that , and it starts to get crowded in the rooms and you might find yourself stepping over each other trying to solve the clues .
my husband and i love ipic theaters . although we live in vegas we frequently travel to scottsdale to enjoy movies in their luxury theater as we have yet to find any other that can compare . when you walk in , it's like you're going into a high end night club . initially you are greeted by a hostess who prints your tickets and answers any questions you may have . to left is a full bar with plenty of seating televisions and to the right there is the snack bar as well as the restaurant tanzy . the theaters have both premium premium plus seats . we always get the premium plus reclining plush seating , pillow , blanket , free popcorn as well as in movie service so you can order food and or drinks throughout the movie . there is a full drink and food menu that include red velvet bread pudding yum ! the servers are always polite , food is excellent and the experience is unmatched .
being from ny spending my summers at the jersey shore enjoying philly cheese steaks . this place brought back memories . regular philly with bell peppers and onions and provolone cheese . my granddaughters first ever . and she said ummm yummy in my tummy .
the worst food ever . the drinks are good specialty unique . the regular drinks have some flair . i would not recommend the food . the chef is obsessed with chili powder and chili sauce . too much no flavor just chili . had the lobster vermicelli it was awful . had the sea bass it was the opposite absolutely flavorless i got a bone in my throat . we sat on the patio there were ants which bite . i do not recommend a high priced miserable meal
well what i liked most was that the food had so many surprises and surprising tastes . i was there about 6 weeks ago now and am sorry this is a later review . but i had a great time . food was good , very good not great . some of the items are very unusual and i liked that . give this place a try for sure . reasonable prices !
russell is the best . very friendly and has good recommendations . try his own shake he came up with salted caramel , peanut butter and oreo . delicious ! burgers are great . try the truffle mushroom with sweet potato fries .
came with a party of 5 and sat on the patio watching the fountains at belaggio . ordered steak chicken and scallops . scallops were mediocre the steak looked like they had pounded it and it just wasn't very good . after dinner at echo and rig the night before this was a little bit of a let down . service was the only saving factor from getting only two stars . our server was great and very attentive without being annoying .
mediocre food at ok prices . the good you can get a $ 10 burger in a sit down restaurant . huge menu . decent atmosphere , friendly service . the bad huge menu jack of all trades , master of none . none of the dishes seem inspired . everything seems competently made , but nothing really stands out . inconsistent quality . sometimes their fish is good , sometimes dry dry dry .
damn you u swirl . you got me ! i am officially addicted ! like . hi my name is deana , i am a u swril addict , and i need help ! i love love love this place , to the point that i dont even want to eat anything else except frozen yogurt ! its vegas , 100 degrees outside and if my body could sustain itself on this stuff alone i would eat nothing else . they have 15 non fat flavors , and 1 low fat flavor peanut butter to choose from and all the toppings your lil heart desires ! although since i find myself here 3 to 4 times a week as of present , i am trying to hold off on the topping and just get the yogurt . i do get about 4 like pieces of chocolate chip cookie dough and mix those 4 pieces in so i do get i surprise in a few of my bits but other than that i am trying to be good ! my favorite flavors are . the english toffee , cheesecake and cookies n cream all in one cup ! can you say . yum ! ? ! i have no self control when it comes to this place , which is a scary thing ! i usually get a cup that costs between $ 4 5 and at $ . 36 or $ . 38 oz its not a small cup , i try not to eat it all in one sitting and usually i have a surprise waiting for me in the freezer when i wake up in the morning the next day ! bonus ! i highly recommend this place if you like frozen yogurt ! ok , review over , im off to u swirl .
fixed our tire in under 20 minutes and were super nice ! thankful that they're open on a sunday !
our new favorite place ! the pizza is so good and the staff is friendly and efficient . great food , great service we will be eating there a lot !
super fun and super yummy . charming staff , cute digs , and creative , affordable , fun food and cocktails . we came with a toddler and they treated her and us like gold .
was in tonight with some friends that were renewing vows . elvis was awesome ! handsome and sang wonderful was a good time !
just go here simple as that . best fast food burger in the country ! quality comes at a price oh and the fries ? killer !
discovered this little gem while i was seeking a new dress that was fun and summery for a dinner function . i needed something that was playful and still elegant at the same time . my usual go to is the little black dress , but i wanted to use some color to mix it up for the night . using my yelp app this came up as a suggestion , so yes yelp knew what i was looking for . the yelp app is amazing for seeking what one might be looking for with just a few key words . it brought me here ! when first coming up to the store the name immediately conveys strength and empowerment . this is very important since i feel the business is strong in the support of women's rights and issues . they are a small business here in vegas and from the reviews prior and on google they are involved in the community here ! the stores audience swings towards a retro fun attitude . the dresses that they sell here are vintage in style , but not from grandmas closet . they are all new and beautiful pieces that one will fall in love with . most of the clothing here is redesigns of those old favorites . the prices on a lot of vintage clothing if it is not a designer brand such as dior or channel still will set one back for these fashions from decades ago . i am one to stay away from vintage clothing for these reasons . i know these pieces from back in the day are amazing , but too many of these purchases have not worked out for me . the garment would tear or wear once and cannot love anymore . this you will not encounter here . there clothing is new and inspired by retro designs . the cut and fit of their dresses are amazing ! it made me feel so lady like , and beautiful . i have gotten so many compliments on wearing it today ! now there is a small vintage section located near the back , but i for one try at your own risk . it is nothing against anything they have for sale in the store . in fact there vintage area is very clean and the prices are labeled so the customer does not have to guess the price ! it's just not my thing . you will not be disappointed here the wonderful staff is helpful and knowledgeable . hopefully you will find that fun new addition to your wardrobe here too !
our family loves coming here for brunch . kids love the waffles and burgers . they have a good selection of vegetarian options as well for those with dietary restrictions . personally my favourite is the polski benny with the cured salmon .
great place to get yourself fresh . three weeks latter and i'm still on low maint ! top and front . ask for the first chair who is borris . cash only folks .
loved this place when it was sugar factory . love it even more now . the bloody mary is still the best in the entire world and the food was actually super good . our waiter sean s . was brilliant . super friendly from the very beginning and gave us pretty incredible service for how crowded it was . everything came exactly as we ordered it . it was a birthday brunch and it was perfect . so thanks sean and hexx !
we were going to use cafe du lac to cater our wedding . we had shopped around and kathryn the owner had given us a fantastic quote . we decided to use them after tasting the food and we did enjoy the food to be fair . kathryn's quote more than doubled after we added in 25 people and it came time for her to crunch the numbers . we were shocked and she basically admitted she screwed up the first quote big time . she did not apologize or offer any sort of compensation . needless to say , we found another caterer jayne's gourmet catering who was amazing ! i was not impressed with cafe du lac's attempt to run a catering business or kathryn's ambivalent attitide at losing a customer .
pretty big place that has great food ! i'd say that this place is better than the golden nugget buffet that i went to on the other night . this buffet is so much cheaper like only $ 6 or $ 7 and has a variety of delicious foods . i literally stuffed my gut until i couldn't anymore because everything looked so good especially the desserts i think this buffet was voted the best buffet in downtown las vegas ! it's on a billboard somewhere p you should definitely give it a try if you're in the downtown area ! just a short walk from the fremont street experience .
ate here for lunch . extensive offerings . didn't eat anything that was less than above average . one of the few buffets i've had that i could classify as under priced compared to other strip options .
this place was wonderful and cheap . with their kids pricing i could take my family of six to a sit down restaurant and fill up for less than 30 bucks . i can't even do that at wendy's ! alas they sold out , and what was once good about this buffet price , spring rolls is now not worth the price .
houston s used to be the best restaurant in town . but their portion size has gotten so small and quality is just not it used to be to justify raising their prices . i ordered a hickory burger with fries and barely had enough fries for a child . my wife ordered a salad that again looked like it was on the child's menu .
decided to try their services since i'm going to vegas a couple of times this summer . signed up online and got in ghostbar for free with a free drink , guys for free too . i'm totally gonna go to their website for the rest of the summer and every time i go to vegas . thanks !
craving ramen and this place hit the spot . got tokamatsu soup with chicken . it was not crowded . love the reggae music .
we went to lager and vine as a family for a saturday lunch . we all ordered different things from the menu and they were all very good . service was excellent also . we will be back !
today , i met a colleague in the 'burbs . taking lakeshore for years from parkdale to etobicoke doesn't thrill me , but this cute aussie coffee shop was worth the drive . i've enjoyed a latte , a mint tea and the actually australian man near me just gave props to the pastry chef for making his treat just like it would be back home . clearly , i have some research to do on australian treats . i plan on doing here through extensive taste tests . wonderful for coworking , bright , airy and clearly a neighbourhood favourite . enjoy , mate .
the burgers were good but i have had better . the fries were stale and weren't as good as we were told . the service was decent , but we received our burgers and then our fries about 5 minutes later . i really believe the rave about this place is just because of gordon ramsey's popular name and because it's in the vegas strip .
i happened to be in town for a conference and was staying nearby . this little place was within walking distance of my accommodations , and had decent reviews so i decided to give it a shot . the food was fantastic . fresh , well prepared and delicious . i started with the caprese salad , and had the ribeye special for my main . i have now gone back a second time subsequent trip and tried the kurobuta pork risotto , which was absolutely delicious . don't think twice about this place , it's absolutely worth a try !
we stumbled on this place by accident one day and boy , are we glad we found it ! the atmosphere is charming , service is good a novelty in montreal , and we were delighted with the fresh croissants , salads , and sandwiches . a great place .
very disappointing . we have been to the hash house in san diego and were blown away . they were packed , we waited an hour in the sun and left very happy . the food was amazing and the atmosphere was cool . we were excited to discover a hash house in our hotel . this one felt like a slightly nicer denny's with huge portions . the food was almost as bland as our waitress . she never once cracked a smile , she actually seemed very annoyed that we were there . and we aren't stinky or rude . i didn't even complain that she put mushrooms on my omelette that i didn't order . i just ate them and pre wrote this review in my head .
bought the groupon which was a cool deal ! emailed my reservation . showed on time and my son had an amazing ride in a lamborghini . plenty of time for pictures and the owner carlos was great . good experience
i used to love this restaurant . in fact i would tell all my friends about it . but for some reason , the last two times my husband and i were unimpressed with our meals . he got the antipasto and i got the gnocchi . my to go portion was skimpy and i didn't get any garlic bread . my caesar salad was underwhelming . i was disappointed that i chose this as my mother's day meal update since my review , david , the owner , reached out to me and offered to make right previous wrongs . i must say that this last meal was more like i remembered of past spaghetty western trips . the mushroom ravioli , antipasto , and the western salad were great . the veal was good . thank you david for the chance to experience the spaghetty western i used to love . we will be back !
stopped by this morning to pick up a quick bite to eat before work . i tried the acaii berry parfait , and i loved it ! i'm going to have to start getting one on a regular basis . great job pomegranate !
i totally agree with the ny times when they say it's the best pizzeria in america . a limited menu and they focus on what they know . and they do it so well . it's classics with a delicious twist done right .
none of us had ever had venezuelan food before , so we were unsure of what to expect . we walked in , completely confused by the menu and what arepas were . the staff were so informative and also showed us what one looked like prior to ordering . i ordered the chicken arepas , with an avocado mayo and cilantro . the arepas itself was absolutely amazing . full of flavor , paired by a delicious , warm rice or corn buns . best part , they're naturally gluten free !
saturday , march 10th . 7 30 p . m . my husband's birthday dinner . the scallop appetizer was tough , dry , and overcooked . even after we sent it back and got a new one , it was still overcooked ! we never got the salad that was supposed to come with the dinner , until after dinner was over and the bill arrived . we were never even offered the salad , or asked what kind of dressing we would like ! i happened to notice . when the bill arrived , that a salad was supposed to have been included ! it is for these reasons that i say that jose was a terrible waiter . he did not take good care of us at all . hence the $ 10 . 00 tip . his tip would have better had he taken better care of us . he was also not particularly personable . our busser was nice , and the manager , gary , offered to take care of our meal the next time we dine there . hopefully we will be able to give a better review next time ! we have been here several times in the past , without incident . and enjoyed our experience . this time , however , was a terrible disappointment . i'm sorry that it had to have happened on my husband's birthday . it kind of put a damper on our evening .
came here last night to watch the panthers game . we arrived 30 minutes before kickoff and , as expected , it was packed ! we had no chance of getting a table and the hostess said one wouldn't be available until after the game . so , just note , that if you want a table here for a big game , come super early ! . we headed to the bar and were content with standing and watching with everyone else in the bar area . they have a good amount of beers on tap and thursdays is $ 3 nc beer night . yay for shotgun betty ! didn't eat food on this specific occasion but we have eaten here many times and the food is pretty decent bar food . will update this review with specific food items next time we go .
it's a shame i'm very fond of their food but they've messed up our order the last 2 times in a row . today we ordered french fries and they never came out , when the waiter with dark short hair and beard brought the check i asked him if he charged me for the fries that never came out and he said sure didn't after inspecting the receipt . if this was a staff member who cared for his place of employment or loyal clients he would have offered to make them really fast or done something to make up for his mistake .
i've not visited the restaurant yet , but i had the pleasure of having doug's take home mac and cheese , and as an omni , i was frankly prepared to moderate my expectations when evaluating the dish , but it was staggeringly good , and i can honestly say one of the very best mac and cheese dishes i've ever had in my life , vegan or otherwise . absolutely loved it !
east ocean is love . east ocean is life . definitely the best authentic chinese food in vegas , with a huge menu . try the hot and sour soup and the whole crab .
food is pretty much on par with other asian legend locations . however , the service is extremely lacking . when coming into the door , there is no reception or employee greeting us , which was not a big deal . but , when trying to wave an employee down to give us a table , all the employees were intentionally looking away . also , trying to get an employee to provide us with napkins or tea was a mission . i rather go to other asian legend locations that provides better service .
had a rental car for more than a week due to my car being in the auto body shop . returned the car with ease and then had to get back in to a rental 20 minutes later because the auto body shop did not do the paint job on my car correctly . ryan s . and adrian were more than helpful through this entire process .
i visited toronto during tiff and i was so surprised we were able to get a seat at this amazing little restaurant . the host was great , he insisted that we wait for a seat on the terrace , and i'm glad we did ! it was so cozy and made the experience that much better . we were there for brunch . we had the lamb chops , leek and potato soup , and quiche lorraine . the flavors were amazing , and they served just the right portions to fill you up . if you want authentic french cuisine give marcel's a try .
great food . great service . love the variety and location . . tons of options from salad to burgers to small plates
great coffee , spotless and cute . tasty eggs benedict with an usual sauce , not classic hollandaise nice twist with a touch of chilli powder . potatoes were perfectly crispy on outside and soft like butter on inside .
stumbled across this jewel when my sister and i went for lunch down the street . decided to go in after we spotted the beautiful cake and macaron display through the window . the cakes and macarons are made inhouse by 8 amazing bakers . apparently each day they sell thousands of dollars worth of macarons ! this location is central downtown . they serve fresh inhouse croissants and bagels with salmon etc . the service is excellent . the entertaining staff is a bonus !
i was very worried after reading these yelp reviews about my decision to stay there . this worrying was for nothing ! i very much enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back . we checked in around midnight and upon getting to the desk , the clerk let me know that the only king sized room was in smoking not what i reserved , even though i called last week and they told me everything was in the system and i thought , here we go . the clerk was super friendly though and told us they could put us in a king suite on the 18th floor for that night , but if we would have to move tomorrow unless we wanted to pay an extra $ 100 a night . in the morning , we called and probably because of reservation issues they asked if we just wanted to stay there complimentary . um yeah ! we had a high roller view two bathrooms , score ! so do they need to work out some kinks in their reservation system ? yes . however , how can i deduct any stars when they put us in a suite for our four night stay ? as for noise . the walls are a little thin , but i only heard people in the halls few times , not in their rooms . the pool area is very nice , but the music is loud . i can see if you want to sleep past 10am and were on the 2nd or 3rd floor facing the pool , it could be hard to sleep . at night there is entertainment on the promenade and you can hear it from some of the rooms . but it's vegas and you're staying on the strip . what do you expect , a lights out at 11 ? the rooms were very clean and the housekeeping staff was extremely friendly ! in fact , every person we encountered there , dealers , bartenders , etc . were helpful and nice ! i enjoyed playing there probably the most of any of the casinos because of the dealers ! the price is amazing for the location ! if you are going to stay here , i wouldn't worry about the other reviews . i feel as if some of these people complain just to complain and nothing world satisfy them . if you want the four seasons , go check in there and pay the four seasons prices . if you want a nice room on the strip for an extremely reasonable price go here !
i have had cell phone service with verizon for over 15 years . that's where most people will say why anyway . my cell phone was stolen . took 2 days to get replacement phone friday went to store and asked for help because first of all problems with replacement phone itself the help ? never even looked me in the eye and only said next . next . no . you have to do that . not our problem . and adamantly said no that cannot be done when asked if we could somehow just lock the phone down . and the negativity continues over 45 min in store i finally asked if he was going to help or should i just start over he said i really doesn't matter to me what you choose so i left . went to the car and called verizon tech help , they were helpful getting me to the point of now i just needed to contact apple . this only took about less than 10 min . monday thought i'd take a chance with a different store and the same exact lack of 0 customer service . verizon stores customer service seems to only want to help if purchasing an item and careless for customer service . 1 100 a 0
one of my besties loves this place , so since it was her b day , i treated her to lunch at dragonfly . it was meh . given the price range , i would expect much better . next time , i'll suggest that we go to wanfu instead !
the only reason i'm giving 2 stars is the guy taking my to go order was really nice helpful . otherwise it was a pretty expensive meal to feed the dogs although they seemed to enjoy it . ordered 3 entrees , explained that i was vegan so no animal products including fish sauce , egg or even honey . listed exactly what i wanted for the pad thai noodles , scallions bean sprouts only , pad see ew with vegetables and panning curry with veggies . it was wrapped up securely for the drive home so it wasn't til i got home started plating the food that i saw that the noodle dishes both were full of veggies scrambled egg . plus i've never seen pad thai sauce that is bright orange really sticky . i didn't try the panang but so didn't eat more than 2 bites his description of the panning pad thai was horrible . i should have read more reviews , xuankieu was so right .
been here numerous times . nothin fancy at the hole in the wall actually two storefronts combined , but damn good bbq and sides .
yummilicious ! went on a groupon . was not disappointed ! have already been back ! love it great salad , pizza , beer selection ! kid friendly , casual . new fav for sure !
normally i wouldn't take the time to post a review about a coffee shop , but the guy at the cash was so staggeringly rude that i had to post about it . this is not the first time i found the staff at cherry bomb to be snotty , but it was definitely the worst experience i've had there . when someone looks annoyed because you interrupted their gossipy conversation with a coworker when you're ordering coffee , then corrects you about your order semantics dude . you know what i'm talking about , don't look at me like i'm an idiot you can have an americano with milk in it it definitely makes you question why you go there in the first place . the coffee is good , but nothing is worth being treated like that . i won't be going back . i live in the neighbourhood and there's other good coffee shops on the same street .
duckworth's is our go to restaurant near our home . the service is always great and so is the food . they have a good menu selection which allows for every family member to find something that they love . my personal favorite is the carolina burger with chili , slaw and onions . being on a no carb diet i order this without the bun and and it 100 satisfies me with very few carbs . my daughter and i both love the cheese sticks and my son likes everything there . i would also like to note that their wings outdo most other places . seriously a must eat at place for those that have never been there .
agent messed up the order , and item returned to sender . called the store to try to fix the issue , but they didn't know what to do .
service sucks to the max , waited 25 minutes to be seated then waited another 45 50 minutes for the food that's was just soso ugh wastedtime
food and service is always great every time me and my boyfriend have came here . pancakes are delicious !
my recent experience here has inspired me to finally after years of using yelp start writing reviews ! don't get me wrong the food is pretty good and cheap ! but the service i received was horrible ! i always get takeout and there was no problem but me and my friend stopped by to eat lunch and were in awe by this experience . we got our food quick and it was good as always but we quickly got full and had pretty full plates . we asked for to go boxes and i kid you not we waited 20 minutes for the boxes ! we're they busy ? not really . did they apologize ? nope . as soon as we got the boxes we asked for the bill . guess what ? we waited another 10 mins ! we really complimented on just leaving cash and leaving . i even said it out loud . when he handed us the bill we quickly put in the card and handed it to him before he left ! they only got 2 stars because of the food , none for the service . their attitude is horrible and even worse their customer service ! i'm so glad they're opening a pho place closer to my house than this !
i received my card months ago but never activated it , when calling in to do so i was told it would take 24 hours . that burned me up but not as much as the terrible customer service i got from their representative , extremely rude . what got me even more was that i went to a station and put money on the card before checking online to discover that the card was not active , they apparently were not supposed to put money on an inactive card . this shows a classic example of ineptitude from the go station right through to presto customer service . to be honest there is no point in writing a review or complaining because their are no repercussions to any of them for mistakes and bad service .
this is about my first and last visit to xyz . i was not prepared for the the overcooked plate of perch for lunch . heavily breaded and cooked to cardboard texture , the perch under the dark brown breading was almost as brown . i never send food back and reorder for fear of retaliation . the fries were the best item on the plate , the slaw ok . the space was cold and needs some tlc . i'm not sure i want to try something else as all three of the plates looked the same . perch needs a light crust and being thin fillets , should be cooked to a light brown . how did this place get four stars ?
i ordered a birthday cake from this bakery thinking that it would be really good since one of my relatives constantly gets their birthday cakes from this establishments . upon digging into the cake , i found a piece of an eggshell inside their green tea mousse cake . welp at least i know they use brown eggs . as well , when i went to pick the cake up i noticed a rather foul and dank smell to this place . i decided to give this place a second chance and when i picked up my order i noticed the foul and dank smell again but this time it was so strong my nose could not bear it for another second and i was holding my breath in for as long as i could until i could reach the door . i am now avoiding this place like the plague and trying cakes from other bakeries from now on .
had the kung pao chicken lunch $ 5 . 75 . it was excellent in taste , just the right amount of spice , large portion , fabulous spring roll and the obligatory fortune cookie go with the meal . super clean , really nice staff , choice of booths or tables , and parking close to the door . i have tried many asian restaurants in the east valley , and this is one of my favorites . also , the price is a great value for what you get . i have not yet used their delivery service , but look forward to doing so in the future .
always something wrong with my order . have had pizza be under cooked . always feel like a rushed pizza was thrown together and not properly made . have complained multiple times and hope this franchise gets new owners or management !
a local , down home pittsburgh gem ! if you are looking for a comfy , solid breakfast at an amazing price , barb is your girl . i gotta say , i am a fan of knowing that i am going to get big portions and nice service before walking in the door of an establishment . call it esp , foodie intuition or a keen eye for restaurant signage . either way , i got both . barbs is kinda small , with an outdoor patio that they open up in the summer . haphazard knick knacks , dusty photos a really odd one of an out of focus hummingbird in a wooden frame that confused my dining pal and me , and a corner tv contribute to the ambiance . lots of locals chatting about sports and why so and so is an a hole and can't catch a ball to save his life . if any of this is reminiscent of a relatives' home around the holidays , or sounds vaguely familiar , barb is your girl . or you are also a western pa native . i ordered the veggie omelet , tomatoes , mushrooms and green peppers with egg whites only , wheat toast and hash browns potatoes . nice , solid and tasty with a good amount of veggies . i'm always a fan of the egg white option as well . the potatoes were not doused in grease and butter , but pretty light and fresh and cut in nice chunks ! even though i gave the rest of mine to my pal as i mentioned , the omelet was pretty big ! they were enjoyed ! i would like to be a repeat offender of barbs , and plan on asking the server what's up with the hummingbird photo next time . and re ordering those potatoes !
new place in the neighborhood ! cheap fast food place with yummy food ! i can't say the food was amazziiinnnnng , but it was satisfying . we had our food in less than ten minutes , the food was good , and we had plenty of leftovers . i love love the masaladas ! i would totally go back and try something new .
not my first time at a vegan restaurant , vegenation definitely tops my list of quality , delicious vegan restaurants . fresh and much locally sourced ingredients , i was impressed by the inventive uses of plants posing as meat . i am a meat eater , i guess you'd say paleo pescatarian mostly although i occasionally eat poultry and eggs , no or very rarely dairy , no pork or beef at all . however , plants encompass most of my meals or i should say the larger percentage of my meals are plant based , and i find the importance of eating at least five servings or more of plants a day to be vital to our health . i'm enjoying this sort of revolution towards healthier eating and reduction of processed or filler foods . the live plant wall with hanging tibetan prayer flags overhead , loads of tables and one large community table lends a relaxed and inviting environment . our server was really friendly , very sweet . she even wrote down the cookbooks the head chef likes for my daughter who is always wanting to try more vegan and vegetarian recipes . bill , minus tip , for 3 plates and two drinks was $ 36 . will be returning to vegenation soon service , portion size , atmosphere and quality is top notch .
the food is okay . i ordered the bologonese pasta . the sauce was a little bland . my husband ordered the pepperoni pizza and although he liked it , i thought it had an odd flavor . a smokey flavor , we think from the cheese . our waiter was very nice and attentive . we will return because i would like to try a white sauce .
this place has amazing fresh donuts and the owners are fantastic to deal with . love love love the sweet treats here . way better tht an krispy kreme by far .
my fiance and i reserved the chef's table at cento for our five year anniversary , and were immediately blown away ! from the homemade squid ink pasta , to the signature cocktails , and the bread pudding to end the meal , it was more than we imagined . if you are looking for an intimate and special evening , i would highly recommend the chef's table . oh , and don't forget to interact with the kitchen staff ! they are there to answer all your foodie questions ! after all , your table is in the kitchen !
first off , i visited this establishment by using the drive thru . hence , i expected speedy service at a fast food place , however , it took over 30 minutes for me to get to the window to pay . there were only 2 cars ahead of me ! i asked the woman at the window if they were always this slow after i got my food , of course , and her reply was we're really busy . what has happened to pleasing the customer ? a simple acknowledgement of the time i wasted in line by saying something along the lines of i'm sorry , we're very busy , would have made such a better impression . nope , not returning .
i was here with 3 friends . we all had something different and every dish was delicious ! i wish there was farm craft in my neighborhood !
one of my regular morning spots , thanks to the reasonable pricing for dtlv , great staff , and yummy smoothies and juices .
the brisket is real good . the pulled pork was dry . we got there late in the evening and those were the only meats left sausage as well . i didn't try the sausage . i had the two meat platter $ 12 with potato salad . i didn't like the potato salad . they don't have salt , pepper , or any seasonings besides the bbq sauce which has a strong vinegar taste . i will go back again .
probably the best bang for your buck as far as buffets go on the strip . we came here for the sunday brunch at 3pm , and they switched over to dinner menu at 4pm , woot woot for double selection . good quality food for a reasonable $ 25 , 5 for unlimited champagne . the selection is not quite as big as the wynn , but for the price difference i'd say the bellagio has the better deal . to start out you have the choice of about 5 or 6 different cooked fish items , grilled swordfish , grilled bluenose , roasted bluenose , salmon , seared halibut , grilled chilean sea bass cooked 2 different ways . the cooked fishes items combined with the alaskan king crab legs , snow crab legs and dinner sushi options destroy the wynn's seafood selection . of course there is prime rib , but what buffet doesn't have prime rib , come on , your crappy reno buffet has it . the desserts were really good too , i dunno what my friend susy is talking about saying they're a mess , they all tasted as good as they looked . except those little faux ice cream cones , those weren't good at all . all in all a solid buffet and you'll only need this one meal all day long ! trust me .
whoa ! what happen to ticoz ? this place use to be awesome . as i waited for an eternity to get a drink i looked around the place and it looked like it was in desperate need of some tlc furniture and carpets need to be cleaned , walls need to be repainted . the plants were all dead in the women's restroom . this place is dying a slow death . what used to be a happening place for happy hour was dead , it was sad hour . the service was terrible ! we were sitting in an empty bar and it still took a while to get a drink . my friends and i were going to order apps but they never came back to ask us if we wanted food , thank god too because we would have had to stay there longer . we chugged our drinks and bounced out .
i went here on a friday night for dinner . it was kinda busy but not so much that it was too loud and oppressive . we ordered the cornish pasty and the fish and chips for dinner . the cornish pasty was by far my favorite dish . if i had only that for dinner i would have given 4 stars . the fish and chips though were too thickly breaded . it really over powered the fish , and wasn't even cooked long enough to make the breading crisp . it was just too heavy . i wish the breading was thinner and crisper . this is why i rated only a three . it makes me wonder about the rest of the dishes . maybe i'll get another chance to eat here again .
i called flowers plus after seeing their 20 off promotion on first time orders . the owner didn't know what i was talking about couldn't find the promotion , so he denied my request all while i was listening to him and the receptionist go back and forth while i was still on the line . i cancelled my order , called another floral shop and received excellent service . moral of the story , if you're running a business , be familiar with your own promotions and honor them even if you can't find it . i have better things to do than to make up a yelp discount code .
terrible , would not recommend going here to anyone , they dont have hashbrowns for breakfast , they dont give you american fries after 11am , so you get to eat french fries with your eggs ? who does this ? have done 2 carry out orders and both times they have screwed it up . i will not be going there again , i will drive to mcfarland or oregon for my sunday breakfast .
so slow ! i'm stuck in drive thuru line for 20mins now . order taking girl doesn't even know what she's saying and takes forever to complete orders . it happens all the time at this location . why ? i saw 7 people working on the same shift . not many customers . but why ? are they all idiots ?
9 30 saturday night show real disappointment ! sloppy performance and nowhere close to the acrobatics of of other cirque du soleil mystere or other shows like le reve !
i believe i spoke with catherine i think that was her name , well i was looking for a unit at the day of my move in ne las vegas , she was very nice and helpful . i couldn't make it to the tropicana location so she set it up for me to reserve my unit remotely at a location that was 6mins away from where i was located . amazing ! when i drove to the bonanza location moses was extremely helpful and kind and got everything setup for me ! i highly recommend extraspace for a stress free storage experience !
this is the second eggsmart location i've been to . it's located in a new plaza so there is plenty of parking . the restaurant is decorated in the style of the all the others . it's bright , clean and roomy . the menu is the same as the others . good quality food at a decent price . the staff was attentive and polite . the only issue is with the men's washroom . the urinal is about a foot higher off the ground than it should be . for a tall and good looking person like me , it's not a problem . it would be an issue for someone vertically challenged or young children .
this was my first time going to this salon and i was a little scared at first because i've been so loyal to my last stylist . but i was not disappointed at all ! i came in for a simple trim and my stylist cassie , was absolutely fantastic . she did notice that i have very thick and dry poly hair , so she recommended a conditioning treatment . that is the best thing i've done for my hair in a veeeeery long time . i have history of doing balayage and even going to full blonde , so my hair has been through hell and back . the atmosphere is very clean and very modern . i'll definitely be recommending my friends to come here .
dr . stein saved my life ! i had a routine colonoscopy at the va on 2 16 18 . the next day i started to literally bleed out through my butt . dr . stein and his team built an emergency or in baywood's er and at 3 am sunday morning , went in and fixed what had gone terribly wrong . his office staff have truly tried to work with me to submit and have the va pay his bill , and though it is still in process i feel that they have tried to accommodate my circumstance .
hands down a great experience ! i called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if i needed to make an appointment . the woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours . i went by this morning and their small lot was full so i just sat in my car while i believe who was tim was finished chatting with another guy . i continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while tim quickly inspected my headlight . unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while i was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon . fast forward a few hours later . i just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay , my headlight was replaced ! friendly , honest , fair and quick service . no bs . highly recommend walter's automotive .
morning star cafe is this cute little cafe in a business district area around the corner from the angels tempe diablo stadium . we took our 11u baseball team which totaled to a 24 people parents , players and siblings . they were so welcoming and handled us perfectly . one person the owner was serving all our food and refilling our coffee and he did an outstanding job . the also make latte's and cappuccino's and my husband has the best nutmeg cinnamon vanilla latte . the food was amazing . the bread is baked fresh and is delivered to the cafe every morning from a local bakery . you can really tell that everything is made fresh . i had the spinach , bacon and swiss omelette and it was so flavorful , not greasy and delicisous . their pancakes and omelette portions are big enough to share . the owner's were a very sweet couple and they and their staff were incredible . thank you so much from the t2 orioles 11u baseball team , corona ca
one of my coworkers has mentioned chelsea's more than once and after a morning of walking dogs at aawl , i shot up 40th street to try chelsea's . the interior is contemporary and open , the bar seating is interior but open to the patio . the patio has several tables and umbrellas but i can see how it can fill quick . i arrived at around 1140 , they were still serving brunch which i believe is served till 2 on both saturday and sundays . not really feeling what i saw on the brunch menu , i asked for a lunch full menu . i ordered a white sangria which was refreshing and served with crisp apple slices and juicy sections of orange . i finally decided on the howie burger cooked medium . it is served with a nice gruyere cheese carmelized onions and a dijon sauce . i was expecting the onions to be more simple and not marinated with a balsamic vinegar and i found the dijon sauce excessive and rather sweet . i can't complain too much the burger patty itself was cooked perfectly medium as ordered . all said and done i wish i had ordered the regular burger .

love the seating . the ladies bathroom needs a major update . hard to flush toilets and some leaky ! i've been several times and always got the seating that works for us .
what a great and yummy find ! like some of the other yelpers , i am a vegetarian and at a place with the name of burger bar , i was sceptical to say the least . i was wrong their homemade veggie burger is to die for ! and , the sweet potato fries are the very best i've ever had ! my husband had the kobe beef and absolutely loved it as well . it is a bit pricey , all the fixings are an additional cost , but you're in vegas , so go for it ! they're usually crowded , but if you're in a hurry , hit up the bar , where service is fast and very good .
just ordered from here ! dumplings got here fast and were amazing ! definitely ordering from here again !
amazing hidden gem . what the place lacks in ambiance they make up with incredible and unique food . vegan friendly .
such a wonderful place ! the staff are so friendly and informative . they really take the time to teach the guests and you can tell how much they care about the animals . the enclosures are well kept and the animals are well cared for . great for families as u get to be so close to the animals , see them feed and interact with the keepers . will be coming back every vegas trip .
best burgers in town . very juicy and delicious . nice friendly service . but the onion rings are over price coming in between 35 50 cents each way too much . but those cheeseburgers yummy yummy .
this is a hippy dippy health food store . if you care at all about what you put into your body , shop here . if you prefer processed foods and the typical american diet , don't bother . prices are very reasonable . selection is truly outstanding . great book selection as well . they put on a radio show every weekday morning . the staff is mostly friendly and very knowledgeable .
i do like the place and it does not smell old like so many do . i always find something nice and find the prices more in line with used furniture to make items move
the web portal and doctor are great . his staff who doesn't most of the work are providing bad service . this week i asked for paperwork for blood work as i'm getting very dissy in the mornings . i called for an order to sonora quest and they said no , you must be see the doctor first . i told them i almost went to the hospital about it and they didn't care . i made my appointment but since they are all booked out 6 weeks my options are wait it out and hope nothing serious happens or find a new doctor . dr l you've been great but your underperforming staff in the office continue to provide crappy service and are ruining the practice .
3 . 5 stars . this place is definitely a great spot to come if you work around the area or are a student nearby at u of t . when you see the place from the outside it seems as though it will most typically be a small place , but man oh man , the space this place has is serious . i don't think i have ever really seen so much space at a coffee shop . it seems as though it is the mecca of all things creative . they are open to having companies come in and use their place for meetings and just thinking big . as a big thinker myself i can respect this a lot ! in terms of the coffee , average . i can make just as good of a latte or cappuccino at my house with my at home machine . the food seems to be the thing here . well made , reasonably priced , and overall great . this place could easily be up there as the place to come for coffee lovers if they had some good critical assessment done by some really good baristas . i may be back to this place just because of the innovative vibe it brings . i love being creative and this place could definitely bring that . all in all , not bad . that's it .
2 stars is really a stretch . i normally find la quinta inns very convenient specially when i travel with my 2 small dogs . i had to go to vegas for a 3 day conference , went cheap on my last night of stay and opted for this la quinta branch . staff are really courteous . when i entered my room , the maintenance person was still there fixing something in the bathroom . he was very apologetic so i assured him that he may take his time in finishing his task . it wasn't his fault , the front desk should have informed him that the guest is coming already . the room was typical . the toilet bowl has stains and there was only a bar of soap and a small bottle of lotion by the tub . i know that i went low on the budget that's why i was not expecting much from the room plus this is not the first time i've stayed at a la quinta but unfortunately , the room is quite dirty . there were big carpet stains that smells like urine and the accent chair needs a little more dusting . housekeeping has a lot to improve on .
the food was truly amazing and unique . my shrimp tempura tacos were special . i don't even know how to describe them because they aren't like anything else i have ever eaten . they were bursting with flavor and had tons of shrimp . my kid got a steak taco with just cheese , avocado and sour cream . the steak was cooked perfectly and frankly i don't think you could make a basic steak taco that tasted better . the house guacamole was fine , but nothing special . the food was definitely 5 star . i gave it 4 stars because i didn't love my margarita , the guac portion was small and the prices were high . we are going back every 2 weeks until i have tried all the flavors of tacos do obviously i would highly recommend this place . enjoy !
a bowl of handmade creamy sweet goodness from cremerie meu meu is really something special that is worthy of tasting again and again . not only is their ice cream handmade , they use high quality all natural organic ingredients . they even go so far as to use disposable spoons made from corn plastic that biodegrades . the tiny little shop lacks seating but is loaded with character . it's pretty clear that every scoop is made by people who care . the greatest thing about this shop is their ice cream . they've got a smorgasbord of basic and rather more creative options using the finest natural ingredients . my favorites are pretty tame and include the fantastic tasting head spinningly strong rum raisin and the classic organic strawberry .
we were very impressed with this company ! great customer service timely responses , great communication , they explained everything that needed to be done to restore our grill . we have a fire magic grill that has been used and abused and is about 9 years old . after they repaired a few things and cleaned it , it looks brand new ! they were very honest and fair . this was not cheap but what we got was worth what we paid !
i just stopped into gentleman joe's to get my sideburns and neck trimmed . immediately after coming in , one of the barbers greeted me and offered me a selection of drinks . there was only a couple minute wait to get in . they have a couple different sitting areas , and loads of tvs . every barbers chair has a tv , and there are several big screens throughout . each barber can change the channel as well . napoleon helped me out . he had to move the barber chair out of the way so i could fit my wheelchair in , which proved a little bit difficult . this things are ridiculously happy ! i was honestly just expecting a couple minutes worth of labor , just a few cuts here and there and i was done . however , it turned out to be 10 to 20 minutes worth of work to get me cleaned up . this man really shows passion in his work . he used multiple sets of clippers , and finished off with a straight razor and hot shaving cream . i've had a lot of trouble in the past with barbers using straight razors . i've only been there once or twice , but the big problem is razor burn . almost every time a barbers used one i end up in pain while they're doing it , and stuck with red razor burn after they do it . not today ! not only did it feel nice and smooth while he was doing it , several hours after the fact i still feel great ! the trim cost $ 10 . i believe the full haircut runs $ 21 . it's definitely worth it , and i plan on coming back . i will definitely recommend this place to friends in the area .
avoid this place ! i went here with some friends because we live nearby and the smell of the food was great every time we've walked by . we finally went to this place and got some swarma , mix plate of food and baklava . the food wasn't bad but we noticed ants on the baklavas still moving around . when we went back to the cashier to exchange it , we noticed a swarm of ants all over the dessert counter on all of their food . i can't imagine the status of their sanitation and other foods after seeing this . food 1 5 , my swarma wasn't bad , moist chicken and tangy sauce but i had a bad taste subconsciously after seeing the ants . service 1 5 , average service when ordering but they didn't show any remorse when we came up to show them about the ants . ambience 2 5 , old and dark but sometimes this isn't too bad as some restaurants still serve great food but this with questionable food makes a bad mix . price 1 5 , too expensive for swarma in toronto . i could go to most places for $ 5 wraps but this place came up to $ 8 . not sure if this is worth it .
highly recommended ! very knowledgeable , professional and friendly . more importantly , very fair prices and only fix what needs to be fixed , not trying to upsell , fix more than is needed , or tell you you need a whole new unit . have used in the past at a house i rent and am a repeat customer different unit than the first time . if you're looking for a tune up or repair , this is probably your guy !
consistently great food and drinks . go before 6 for happy hour prices . try the peach smashed martini and prime rib dip au jus .
just terrible service . i came in and stood at the counter for 3 4 minutes . i was only acknowledged because i was making efforts to find someone to help me . my order was taken then the employee walked away didn't say my total , when i would pay , to have a seat . i'm not a mind reader so i continued standing until she came back . this is why i prefer the other location .
good food . took 15 minutes to make . rice was good . the sauce was good . taste like good chinesses good . fast and decent price .
always stop here as soon as i arrive in town . its like a mini south coast plaza . deffinately a one stop mall .
jacob is a great mechanic . i have a custom chopper that most people in town are afraid to touch . jacob dove right in a complete a major repair . he was very courteous , very clean , and did an amazing job . he will definitely become my regular mechanic .
i decided to replace my kitchen faucet . i have done them before several times but i did not want to get on my back and crawl under the sink again ! i had a good experience with bob and village plumbing last time i used them . no complaints this time either . i got lucky on bob's scheduling again today . i called him at 10 in the morning and he was able to schedule me at 1 in the afternoon the same day . he showed up 10 minutes early . he quoted me rate before he got here . even though there were complications on taking out the costco waterford faucet i had installed he kept to the same price ! i am happy to leave a positive review for bob and this company because one good review can lead up to 10 new customers !
i have never given five stars before . but , everything was perfect . great atmosphere . wonderful happy hour . great service . green chili pork was excellent . buttermilk chicken also delicious . will be back again and again .
i can't help myself . whenever i go here , it's because i'm dying to go here for one thing the vegan shredded pork with vermicelli and some pork eggrolls . so , i can't tell you about lots of menu items . i can tell you that this one is delicious . hue thai has standard meaty vietnamese fare noodles soups , banh mi , bun , etc . and for the adventurous meaties , you can get tripe and blood cubes and all the extra parts . but i can't rate how that tastes ! i can say that they have a fairly large vegan veggie menu with faux meats i've tried the pork , which appears to be shredded tofu and the lemongrass chicken ok , gluten based . you can even get faux pho with a variety of fake meats , but i was not impressed . the broth had no flavour at all to me . they also have all the standard boba fiable drinks , most of which can be made with soy milk . reasonably priced , fairly fast service , and close to ronald's donuts ! if you're vegan and don't know about ronald's donuts . you need to google yelp whatever that shit immediately .
i really liked this small , cute little shop , with friendly chocolatiers offering samples and showing off their interesting creations . it's great that it's local , organic , fair trade , and besides that , the chocolate is super yummy . being an out of towner , i had to try the more creative and exotic things they had , so i had the quebec blue cheese cream , and a rosemary chocolate . unfortunately i had them in the wrong order i should have eaten the more delicate rosemary one before the more pungent blue cheese . but the chocolate was smooth and delicious . mmm
very good french fries and my sub was pretty delicious .
we had dinner this evening at cheddar's in chandler . as many other reviews have stated , the restaurant is attractive and welcoming . the staff was friendly and helpful . our server was nayeli . the service was prompt and attentive . tthe food was all excellent and surprisingly affordably priced . here is what made our experience stand out . my wife ordered the ribs , but found that the sauce was too tangy spicy for her taste . there was not a thing wrong with them , just a matter of taste . our server graciously brought her a menu to pick something else . the manager also came by the table to make sure that we were taken care of . this was all so nicely done , very classy . we will be sure to recommend cheddar's .
margerita pizza crispy fries to go were excellent . only complaint was the unusually small drink , it wasn't worth the money . fries were actually crispy but pop em in the toaster oven or regular oven if you like them reaaally crispy !
service was subpar . they did offer me a free water which was right on time . they didn't really explain the services the company offered . they tried to up sale me towards the end however that is to be expected .
worst experience with marriott ever . we are exclusively dedicated to marriott properties and have been for over 20 years . we booked our three night stay a month ago king size my husband is 6'5 with extra pillows . we checked in to find two queens and no extra pillows . our new room is on a lower floor , we had to go down to ask again for extra pillows because the phone doesn't work , the cabinet is broken and the toilet has leaked all over the bathroom floor . my husband has stayed in marriott properties in several other countries and has always had excellent customer service in the event of any kind of problem . there response has been very disappointing . also , if you like a good soak in the tub don't be fooled by extra large tub in the room description , it's not . we won't be back . update they came to fix the toilet leak and it's leaking again . the bathroom fan does not work , there is mold in the shower and it leaks too . will never come back here . rooms are nicer and actually cheaper on the strip .
we went to their spring open house for their free axe throwing event . the location is situated near yorkdale mall which i find really convenient , however their exact location was hard to find as it was tucked in those industrial area . price is about $ 20 ish for an hour of axe throwing . the staffs there were extremely helpful and friendly . they told us that it started as throwing axes to targets at backyard hence the name backyard , then it became bigger and bigger til they ran out of space at the backyard so the founders decided to rent spaces and made it as the company . they taught us how to throw axes properly and even played games with it . each stations have its own coach that will monitor you and give pointers to improve your throws . ideal place for a bunch of friends , dates , and birthday events . definitely will go back !
i have been here two saturday's in a row for lunch . i love the sushi . it is so fresh . the first weekend we went i only ordered one roll but my second weekend i ordered two . i was so stuffed when i left but when i got home i wish i had ordered some to go . the staff is friendly and the food is great . i would give it 5 stars but i'm from ny and have dined at nobu . this will be a regular stop for me
asian island has good food and they're always on time . i have only ordered online delivery through yelp even though i live across the rd so my review is based on this alone . everything i have ordered has been pretty good . my favorites are the orange chicken , almond or cashew chicken and crab puffs . their sushi is pretty decent also . i love the tiger rolls . the highlight of this place is ordering delivery through yelp ! that's what makes this place 5 stars for me . it's just so easy and convenient , maybe too convenient . ha . on their take out menu there is an option of a free item with 20 , 25 , or 35 or more which is nice , although they have forgotten a couple of times to include . overall i like the food , love the convenience and i am happy with the service .
if you ever ride down carson and pass this little place . turn the car around and stop in ! . the lines can be ridiculously long but it moves very fast and the ice cream is worth it ! blueberry soft serve alone is worth the trip . i love the pretzel cones . if you really want to indulge , have a chocolate chip sundae , you will thank me later ! great find !
great pizza margharita pizza was excellent . great decor simple yet classy . great service owners employees were very nice . great fresh food you can taste the fresh ! bad location i foresee a more in the next year or so . they do not have mt dew . bad everyone cannot be expected to . this is one of the reasons i love yelp . there is a zero percent chance i would have gone here . i am never in the area , would have never noticed it and never heard of it . now , i will be taking my family there and telling everyone about it .
love my lashes xoxo thank you jordan ! i've had my lashes done by lots of artists around the world and have to say this is one of my favourite artists ! looks real , full , flattering w o looking fake of doll like
kim was incredible ! she was super helpful , very responsive and thorough ! i would definitely use her again in the future !
portuguese tarts . my first was in macau . i didn't appreciate it . i had one many years after , once i'd had what i like to call my foodie awakening and i regretted paying so little attention to my first . a friend of mine shared a portuguese tart from nova era with me one day and it was delightful . the inside was wonderfully creamy and the crust was so incredibly flaky . it also wasn't too sweet , which i appreciated a lot . be careful . if you aren't gentle with it , this dessert will fall apart when you bite it , but it's sooo worth it .
went to try out this hula bar with some friends since it's closer to home . loved it we got the scorpion bowl and also my faves coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato frys . it was yummy . and mixed drinks were good also and we brought friends to try it out and they loved it , they said food was yummy and they would definitely come back thanks again hula bar !
finally tried this place out . the food is way overpriced for what you get . low quality overpriced . first time is the last time .
i have been here a few times , burgers are not bad , but as others have reported the tables are often dirty , so i stick to take out . service seems to depend a lot on the cook manager who asks some customers how they want their burgers cooked , but not others . i was watching my burger getting to well cooked and tried to get his attention . he became very rude , waved the burger at me , and then started to insult my family for some reason which i never did understand . when i suggested that he needs to work on his customer service skills he started shouting at me . i have never been treated so poorly in a burger place , i won't be back until its under new management
been going here for a few years now . the food is always consistent . flavors are bold and presentation is visually appealing . the menu has a little bit of everything , from quesadillas and burritos to menudo and lengua . they also have a happy hour from 2 5 in the afternoon with 2 for 1 cocktails . just wish they'd include appetizers as it would probably entice me to go a little more often . the restaurant itself feels cozy and comfortable we always sit in the bar area or on the patio . they also typically have some sort of live entertainment . you can't go wrong with most of the appetizers they offer but i really enjoy their plates . and of course the margaritas are delicious . one of the better options around for sit down mexican food .
killed some time here while waiting to go to the aiprort . my wife and i both had a couple vodka's and the tab was $ 50 , so definitely not cheap the seating was super comfortable deep , leather couches and the service was excellent . great place to people watch and kill time !
these donuts are next level no , they are not cheap but they are delicious the donut dough itself is amazing very light , fluffy , fresh i've had these from the rolling pin and also from mcewan foods , since there's a location right across from my work at shops at don mills the nutella filled is my favorite there's always lots of filling and like the said , the dough itself is really good best donuts i've ever hat
not impressed by the food . service was disappointing . only thing i liked about this place was the decor .
don't let their name fool you ! this establishment specializes in other goods and gifts other than flowers . they have a very nice collection of jewelry , clothing , handbags , seasonal decorations , and much more . there is even an antique store on the lower level of their shop . the staff is very friendly and helpful . they have regular open house events for the holiday season . very comfortable environment .
great place that i recommend to everyone . they have done an exceptional job for everyone i know that has gone to them . just got my car back from an accident and they worked with progressive to get everything done . the car looks brand new even though it is over 90000 miles on my car . amazing job ! friendly staff and great people that work there . i highly recommend ! this is a great family business .
i love this place ! charles is the best , great customer service very informative and friendly . i went into man cave with no cigar knowledge and now several months later i'm still going back learning new things and impressing my man with great cigars . what a great find .
rude rude rude . if i had the option to put a negative 5 star on this i would . i am seriously amazed how rude someone can be . i work for a company and we usually always call to get prices for our preferred vendors list . i decided to call las vegas key shop because they have 5 stars . i have no idea how they have 5 stars . it seriously blows my mind . i called and was speaking to some guy should of gotten his name . it sounded like i woke him up and he was just not a happy camper . not only did i feel rushed but out of kindness i asked him if he was busy at the moment . he answered with no , i am obviously talking to you right now right ? um seriously ? so i responded with you extremely rude , never mind we do not want to use you guys then he told me to kiss his ass . okay absolutely not . unprofessional and it seriously disgust me how someone can be so crewel . do not use these people .
so this is my first time here . heard so much about it . we had a party of 5 . it's a prefix menu we order the 5 course meal which cost around $ 200 n my other friends is 6 course for $ 250 . i like there bread cart and the comp dessert cart . everything was ok to us . no complaints . the place is very fancy n quite . server was great .
everything is nice and clean . signing up was fast and was able to set up auto pay on the spot . on site manager was super nice . everything was convenient . just what i was looking for .
we choose this restaurant based on reviews online and were not disappointed . service was top notch . we met the owner and he asked if everything was well , we said excellent . staff was fast , efficient and very knowledgeable . food was very authentic and tasted great . our family of 10 was very happy ! when in area again we will certainly be back .
you would think that with the advent of mega bookstores with their large selections and deep discounts , that small independent bookstores would lose their place in today's world . if you love to read though , one visit to shelf life books will change your mind , if you ever thought that way to begin with . i don't know what it is , but every time i walk in here , i either walk out with something or have to work hard to hold myself back from purchasing something . it could be the way the store is laid out . it doesn't boast the selection of a chapters or an indigo , although you can special order anything from the front desk . but perhaps the reduced clutter makes it easier to filter through stuff and find things . or it could be a conscious choice with respect to which books get displayed . i was speaking to the owner after a visit where i walked away with three books i had never intended to buy , nor was even looking for , and she said that they try their best to display smart books , and actively try not to display anything with vampires with them . a smarter person would have taken down a list and tried to bargain hunt online later , but i ended up paying full price for my wares for the simple fact that i a wanted them right away and b wasn't confident that i'd find them in stock elsewhere . or maybe the person responsible for the displays has similar tastes as mine . for example , now on my bucket list is a star wars lenticular book that has moving pictures on each page depending on how you tilt it , how to eat organic for $ 5 a day , and the entire ninja cowboy bear presents . children's book series . i would never have found these sorts of books at the competition even if they carried them to begin with , and it was thanks to shelf life books that i was made aware that these kinds of books even existed in the first place . i can honestly say that shelf life books is a place i'll visit more often , especially when i have some spare time to kill in between meetings or other appointments . however , i know i'll need to do a better job at guarding my wallet when i do . 2 30
great pizza and side dishes . the calzones are also great . i am from new jersey and like good ny style pizza and this is my favorite place around . the marinara sauce is a little lacking but that doesn't stop them from having great pizza .
i love noodle soups and instead of our usual pho outing , we decided to give oe a try . and boy oh boy , we were not disappointed . we each ordered n1 lanzhou and n3 n1 with kimchi with a side of wood ear mushroom cold appetizer dish . our noodles arrived piping hot within 5 min of ordering . the broth was nice and earthy tasting and my n3 with the chinese kimchi had a nice kick to it as well . only thing i'll change up for my next visit is to choose thinner noodles as the one that i chose was way too think and not suitable for the slurpy noodle dish i was hoping for that night . i would definitely return to sample more of their offering soon !
what with all the hype up about this place , i have to honestly say , it was mediocre if any . the whole process checking in on the kiosk n being told you have an hour to wait . then ten minutes later you get a text saying you're up , you show up n you have at least a minimum of an hour to wait in line . the hostess that you check in with is rude n not the right person to be at that position when you ask her why the hour wait ? her response is that's how it is . you think caesars would rather you played n gambled your $ while waiting . such a silly system . food was okay , nothing great . cold lobster legs rather than the hot that was expected . would i go back ? nope ! i prefer m's buffet !
by chance we found this place while exploring beaches . an absolute must if you like bbq ! the burnt ends , which sell out quickly for obvious reason , were amazing . great service and a cool patio .
we have been coming here for the past 10 years . it is like cheers , everyone knows your name ! you do have to be a regular for that to happen . the baristas see me coming and make my coffee before i can order it ! the coffee is the best . they roast their own beans . it is so good we have it shipped to our home every other week . the food is very good as well , everything is fresh . i recommend the tuna salad for lunch . you will not regret trying this place out and return again and again
so delicious . service was quick and staff was super friendly . price is outrageous , 2 like it's where $ 16 and some change .
they fit me in the same day and were amazing on the phone . they came in and put 2 shutoff valves to my shower which helped me out a ton . the prices were great and manny got the work done in a very timely fashion . he was very polite and came with solutions not just questions . i would highly recommend to anyone looking for great service .
excellent and quick service . check i . for the first time and they give you free potato skins . i had the greek salmon . it was the best i have ever had . salad bar baked potato and huge portion of salmon for $ 20 . 00 . even got a visit from mr and mrs santa claus .
i have been here a few times , since my kids and i love the custard . though the 4 times we have eaten brazier items i have been disappointed . i have ordered the mushroom swiss burger 2 times and both times seriously lacking mushrooms 5 small sliced mushrooms on one and 3 on the other . i went up to the counter both times and they said that was the standard amount ! ? ! burgers are yummy but very thin patty and too much bun . fries are good but inconsistent in how they are cooked to completion . chicken fingers have breaking that overwhelms the meat . i feel it is not worth the premium prices . $ 48 for 5 kids and 1 adult to eat was more than i would like to pay , for a fast food experience ! disappointing food . amazing custard .
i have to say poolstar is awesome ! my husband has taken care of our pool for years , he finally agreed to let me hire someone to take care of it and he and i both couldn't be happier ! our pool has never been so sparkling clean ! honest reliable and i love our pool guy glen . thank you poolstar , my husband is a tough one to impress he thinks he needs to do everything himself .
the best soft shell crab po boy i have ever had . portions are perfect and the service is great . absolutely a must try
a very very very average vegas bar . average prices for average drinks $ 14 for scotch on the rocks . average entry fee $ 20 on saturday . roof top view that fails to impress . average looking crowd , more 30 than 20 . will not be back .
pizza and service was excellent . dino and his staff are very nice . the crust was excellent . everything was perfect .
this sheetz has the best ketchup and ranch . if looking for a tasty bite to eat , stop here . the air machine never works though .
ate here for lunch for the first time and i thought the food was really good . the lady made me a monster of a sandwich which i ended up taking half of it home with me . the flavors were great and the bread was fresh and delicious . the quality seemed much higher than other fast food sandwich shops but to me they lack in having different choices . which may be a good thing though , since they can concentrate on making higher grade food than having to deal with a huge menu quality not quantity sorta thing . i would for sure go back here , i saw there is one up in wa state my neck of the woods so i will have to go hunt that one down and see if it lives up to my vegas port of subs experience .
awesome place ! great decor , great environment , tasty sandwiches and smoothies .
family owned , great customer service , delicious food , big portions , well priced this is the first time i've been here . i always thought it was a chain restaurant , but it turns out it's a mom and pop restaurant owned by a very nice lady , carol . she's genuinely friendly and checks on her customers . i noticed she knew her regulars by name , was bussing tables herself , holding open doors for people and checking on the customers . when she came by to check on me , she cleared one of my plates , and we chatted for a bit . she even asked my name . when i was talking to her , i found out she was the owner . atmosphere friendly , casual , indoor and patio self seating you order at the counter , and they give you a number . you can sit inside or out side on the patio area wherever there's an open table . you put your number on the stand on the table and they bring your food out to you . maybe it just happened to be the day , but the customers were also super friendly . dog friendly patio i also noticed people had their dogs on the patio . one of the girls that works here went up to a table and asked if they wanted some dog treats for their pup . food delicious , large portions , well priced i ordered the strawberry french toast , an egg sunny side up and a side of potatoes . good thing i brought my appetite ! the food was delicious and it came out faster than i anticipated , especially with it being a busy sunday morning . the food was delicious . the egg was perfectly cooked , the potatoes had a great flavor , i didn't even use ketchup or hot sauce with them and the french toast was amazing and the strawberries were really fresh . the soy latte with caramel was awesome ! i may have found my new favorite coffee place !
we went here last night after the super awesome yelp event to have a cocktail . we were greeted by shawn , a very hospitable bartender . he was great ! my friend and i were literally the only people there ! the ambience was like a nightclub with neon lights and modern furniture strategically placed to leave enough for a dance floor . it was a little too bright for my liking . we didn't try any of their food or their champagne cocktails . i was in the mood for beer . i had a southern tier pumking with a side of fireball . yum ! perfect ending to my evening ! would definitely go back to visit shawn and try some of their menu .
this was my first visit so i was worried , if i would be disappointed . but i must say that food was super good and impressive , i just wish that our server could have mention us that the food comes in a big portion so it would be too much for two people , other than that everything was great . so keep in mind before ordering ask for portions .
this place is awesome ! the captain crunch pancakes are amazing ! prices seem expensive at first but once you get the food , it is worth it ! awesome view of all charlotte and overall a great experience !
stay away from this place ! apartments are very old . took an apartment only because there is a big indian community and my employer had a discount with them . maintenance and customer service are not good . takes days for maintenance personnel to come in . also , my apartment got infested with roaches because the maintenance person opened up a hole underneath the sink and maintenance did not do much afterwards to get rid of the infestation . i spent the last 6 months of my lease duration living in a roach infested apartment . living amidst roaches was the case with my neighbors as well . because of the older nature of the apartments , roach infestation is more than likely . when you terminate the lease , they do not account for normal wear and tear and they charge a premium for repairs . they do not care for tenant reviews or tenant satisfaction . they get people primarily because of the indian community whose employers provide a discount . they try to charge as much from the resident once his her lease is done and they cannot be reasoned with . learning a lesson from islander , i have moved onto a much better apt community where the leasing staff sound to be way more 'reasonable' and care for tenant satisfaction
beautiful ! not the usual buffet . great cheese plates and cold cuts but the hot food wasn't special . tasty , but don't build it up in your head .
been going to this community centre for almost 18 years for swim classes , camps and other activities there . this building has it all large swimming pool , great library , camps available during the summer , soccer fields and a recreational gym for sports . and if that does not make you excited , they have a large splash pad and jungle gym at the back of the facility . great place to hangout with friends , get a good workout and just to relax with the family . the pool has a lot of recreational times for families , as well as lane and fitness classes everyday . current customer for 18 years , and will keep going here no matter what .
great breakfast been here maybe 6 times . usually get classic , have gotten the eggs benny poutine once too and was shared between 2 ppl . early bird special is a good deal if you make it before 10am . i usually get freshly squeezed oj with mine , and drinks like pop are full sized bottles . usually a few others dining but never packed , plus we never have to wait too long for anything
we remember coming here last time and not knowing which dish to try from their square grid menu . the taste menu option is certainly a great alternative as an introduction . kinka means golden flower we were told , something which bring happiness to everyone . it definitely did to us . as much as the deep fried breaded chicken with garlic mayo on the side sounds simple and fastfood like , the dish left us in awe . the meat was very flavorful and soft which was aided by presumably long marination in soy sauce and a dash of sake .
everyone here is awesome ! i had the pleasure of dealing with carl and seth . no pressure , no up sell , straight and to the point . i live 1 . 5 hours away and purchased my 2016 outlander here , so that in its self means something . every dealer tries to sneak some added charges here , but not big two , which i was surprised . when i called carl , the sales manager , to finalize my deal , he had the vehicle pulled and prepped my for delivery on this busy memorial day weekend right before they closed without even pulling my wife's credit and just by my words that we would qualify for the 0 for 72 months . low and behold , when we got there , outlander was parked right in front , washed , ready to go . he even expressed to me on call on the way up to big two that his day was filled with a few people with sub par credit , so in my mind he could of categorized me with those people and ask for my wife's social so they could double check before wasting everyone's time , but nothing . wow , they took my word for it , that means alot me . it shows they really care about their customers , my son and daughter will be driving soon , i will definitely be back ! we love our outlander , thank you big two !
food was overpriced considering its small portion . got the holy chuck burger and cowlorie burger . both burgers were dripping in oil and soaked through the bun . service was okay .
it took thirty mumble mumble years of my adult life to finally enter into the hallowed halls of the infamous pmall . truth be told the rumors of their dangerous parking lot kept me from crossing the threshold from steeles and kennedy into the bermuda triangle of no return . finally this weekend i was forced to weather the parking lot storm as i attended the taste of asia festival . the hype was certainly on point as i spent the better part of 30 minutes playing vehicular dodgeball minus the balls as i searched for parking . mind you this was mostly simply due to volume and not poor driving as the rumors had suggested . that was until i was exiting later that day . i actually watched a woman drive against oncoming traffic on a 1 lane each way enter exit to the parking lot and attempt to marge in with the exiting traffic whilst blocking oncoming traffic entering . lets just say she got a few choice hand gestures and an ear full from several peoples horns including my own . enough about the parking , now what lies inside these doors . a lot . of nothing . if you're looking to get some bubble tea , or get your nails done , or buy cell phones or cell phone accessories . or cell phone accessories . or cell phone accessories . or cell phone accessories . you're all set . after about the 100th cell phone case store i decided i was good and didn't bother to check out the food court which is supposed to be legendary . i figure i'll save that for my next visit . there were some other shops , like a hobby shop selling replica guns o , the various knock off designer clothing handbag shops or the many clearance sale stores whose clearance signs were so aged you wonder if this is the longest sale ever . i think what i did like was how bright and clean the space was . i also loved how pacific mall provides various sized store fronts for vendors . i can't speak as to what their rents are but many of these shops would be kiosks in a regular mall , so it's nice to see them having a solid store front they can lock up at night and call their own so props to supporting local micro business owners p mall ! can't say i'll be back again too soon but for what it is . it's aiiiight !
the pho was excellent , i had the regular one with round steak . everything was as i wanted , fresh veggies , good cut of steak , and very flavorful broth . i would describe the broth as well rounded , the flavor profile didn't lean one way or another . overall this is great quality pho in downtown cleveland !
yelp recommended this place while we traveled from charlotte to charleston and was pleasantly surprised . we were sat immediately and football was on we ordered the poutine which is a huge portion ! we ordered the 12 inch supreme pizza and it was plenty big for us 2 . nichole was great and friendly and was on top of her game . i hope to stop by again one day . we really enjoyed it !
this is not a very customer service oriented panda . every time i have been in there , they are cleaning grills and do not want to make any fresh entrees .
my finance emailed the concierge a month prior to our arrival to let him know we were getting engaged during our time there , he responded by asking him to call him . after leaving him 2 messages no returned phone call , so he got theater tickets and dinner reservations himself and pulled off a beautiful evening . he couldn't even get the hotel to assist with getting a car to pick us up from the executive terminal from the airport as we flew in private . with all the money that he spent for the weekend , the staff did not help him at all and for a ritz this is not up to their normal standard ! he pulled off a beautiful weekend , but not with their help . 5 stair for him , not for them . we have stay their in the past with much better service . they need to re look at their standards and go back to the way they treated their guests before . breakfast left a lot to be desired . the hotel is beautiful but i will leave it at that .
i've had my hair cut by nadine several times , and i will definitely keep going back to her ! i have big , long , curly hair , which can be a challenge to some hairdressers , but she does a great job and doesn't mind that my hair can be a time consuming appt !
i think jan and her staff are amazing ! she's done great things with my daughter , and she's made a lot of progress . while they don't accept my insurance , i continue to pay cash for my daughter's visits , simply because i love this place so much ! i highly recommend this place !
this movie theater is amazing and worth the drive . i have only been to the galaxy theater over off of craig road on the north side of town . i love the small cozy and intimate setting of these theaters . i usually see the majority of my movies at the palms however for fifty cents more why not come here and enjoy a movie on your back the chairs are like modern fancy lazy boys that completely recline . the seats are assigned so no rush to show up early to search for good seats like at a regular theater . i like that each recliner has its own table top for your drinks and snacks so you do not have to hold them during the movie . also you are not rubbing elbows with the stranger next to you . i really enjoy this experience . i just wish there was one located in the sw part of town . a shout out to my buddy raymond for taking me here it was a real treat ! it is a fun experience indeed !
d and i were craving a steak dinner the other night , so we did some searching to see what airdrie has to offer with decent reviews . we thought we'd give this place a try and it's a touch old fashioned but they kept their food tasty . we started out sharing a zucchini sticks plate . the zucchini itself was fresh , not too juicy so they didn't drip everywhere like you get with white spot back in bc , and the batter was crisp and well seasoned . the tzatziki dip was really good on its own , high quality thick dip with lots of cucumber bits , but it was not the right dip for zucchini . a fresh ranch would have been a better complimentary flavour for the zucchini and batter seasoning . for the main course we each had an 8oz new york with a soup to start for him and salad for me . he had the potato bacon soup which was supposedly absolutely delicious , and my salad was a simple lettuce and tomato salad with thousand island dressing . the dressing came in a little take out cup which was strange and i felt bad using something that would just go in the garbage rather than being washable , but the dressing itself was great . the steaks were cooked just right , medium rare so the thin cuts were still nicely pink in the middle . the flavour was great with light seasoning and a rich buttery coating that was delicious . the vegetables were perfectly steamed carrots and broccoli coated in hollandaise . that was a pleasant surprise as we both love all three of those especially when put together . for the final side i had the stuffed potato and he had the rice . the rice was simple , with a few vegetables thrown in , and looked pretty good but i think i had the better side with the potato . the stuffed potato was delicious with cheese , herbs and bacon bits in it . the splatter of dried parsley around the outside of the plates is a bit dated and should probably be ditched as it's more messy than attractive now . a clean edged plate would be nicer , and it doesn't add anything to the meal . all in all the food was tasty and we while we're staying in airdrie we will probably go back .
great place , echoing all the other excellent reviews . i had been planning to go for ages and finally made it , primarily to ask about dry aged steaks . found out that they are available , although not on that day . instead had some first rate rib lamb chops , expertly trimmed as i watched , and some great bacon . have now ordered a thanksgiving turkey and am very much looking forward to that , and to my future trips to dj's .
i was eating watching the employees prepare the food and take orders . no one was standing around or goofing off everyone was working hard and getting guests thru the line . the fries are to die for !
i was so excited to find this drive thru restaurant ! the food is yummy and it's drive thru ! perfect on a work nite when u don't want 2 cook . we have tried the spaghetti , lasagna and bread sticks .
do not use this outfit ! we went today and spent more than 1 . 5 hours only to have the ortho tell us that my daughter needed to go back to the dentist first . terrible customer service and cavalier with customer's time . will not be going back .
great law firm , i have worked with them on many occasions . all of their staff is great from reception to the attorneys . highly recommended .
fantastic , best cupcake i have had in durham , and i have tried many places . cupcakes are iced at the time of order , so no worry about thick crusts . soft , moist cake . tons of flavours to choose from . worth the extra 5 minute drive , cupcake canada is closest to my house but now i won't have to settle for hit or miss cupcakes .
this is definitly good food . the price is good . my favorite is the coconut shrimp . they have an extensive choice for kids too , like pizza and french fries , mini hot dogs . this is the only chinese restarurant i have been to in the cleveland area . but my comparison with others in los angeles , this place is pretty good . i definitly recomend !
i gotta admit , an adult's only pool with topless sunbathing and good drinks make for a great day . came here with three friends and the activities of the crowd entertained us for hours . first of all when it's 106 , lotion up and more importantly start drinking both water and the cocktails . second , you should come in here knowing it's a topless pool . these four dudes walked in and the lead asian guy turned his head and saw four bountiful breasts . he turned back forward then did two count em two double takes back . jeez bud , could you be a bit more obvious ? haha . didn't gamble but the chips and guacamole were good . the only complaint was that the music was a little loud turn it down a bit and all will be perfect !
they hand wash , and they are quick . the car is not all that clean though , even compared to other hand wash places for the same price . i would not go for anything more than a quick wash . they try to upsell , but i told them that the reviews on yelp indicated the detailing work was no good . so this is not the right place for detailing . the place is very nice and clean . they do oil changes too . too bad the quality of work is not good . i will be back , unless i can find another hand wash place .
clark was well informed and honest about the products . he installed the solar screen in a timely manner . very professional .
i've stayed at this hotel only 3x and don't know why i bothered to give them another shot . thinking their attitude would improve . me thinks not . 1 was there around thanksgiving this year and the quality of the rooms were as follows a carpet corners looked like a cat dog has been chewing and naw ing on them for the last few years . bathrooms had wallpaper covering older wallpaper . why wouldn't you strip it and just redo it or paint it ? the beds were horrible . the mattresses clearly were not replaced in years . the tv we now have lcd and what's with the old cabinets ? we had 2 little lamps and one electric socket that wasn't working . 2 when explaining our unhappiness with the room , the front desk asked us so what do you want us to do about it ? . i thought to myself you have got to be kidding me . the economy is bad but there are 150 other hotels to go to and they think their entitled ? 3 after mulling through 3 managers and raising a stink were we able to get issued a food credit . even that took more than 6 hours to get . disappointed in overall service , their total rewards program how they are different owners operators from the hotel that is . getting things comped isn't so easy and unless you're famous , their motto seems to be just to stand in line . sorry guys , but our family had other options and we regret we chose your establishment to stay . the long and short is this don't get suckered into paying anything extra for a room that they cannot guarantee for you because you may end up in a worse off room and even asking to change properties won't happen . i will never stay here again and i will stay at the westin or off the strip before staying here ever again . i don't care if they offered the rooms for free . the hotel overall is smoky , dingy in the hallways , and not quick to respond to fixing things . they will get to it when they can and that can take up to 1 . 5 days . for the prices of these rooms at retail , go stay at vdara or cosmopolitan . even the bellagio standard rooms are nicer than this place .
we tried dw bistro for lunch . a special was the pulled pork sandwich with carmelized onions and comes the choice of sweet potato fries or salad . the sandwich was bursting with flavor . next time i will order the salad . even though the fries were good the sandwich bun provides enough carbs . since this was our first visit our server offered a complementry desert . although we didn't think we had room for desert we chose the carrot cake . our server suggested to box the cake to go . however when the cake arrived it looked to good to take home and none was left in the box . the restaurant has a friendly ambiance , brightly lit , lively music and top notch service . look forward to trying brunch .
this is the first time i've been there since the new owners took over . i was pleasantly surprised that things only got better . food was great and promptly served . wait staff fantastic . my kids . pickiest kids ever enjoyed every bit of their grilled cheese , mac and cheese and crispy fries , i even had some . yum !
food was fantastic ! shrimp cocktail was amazing ! i ordered pancakes with eggs and my fiance got an omelette . while the food was fantastic the only reason for 4 stars vs . 5 is the under staffing . we had to wait in line for about 30 minutes , no big deal i understood that . the problem was once we were seated . our waitress was very friendly and she was trying really hard to accommodate all of her tables . we had to flag her down to get a second cup of coffee and some water and then at the end of our meal we had to flag her down for the check . you could tell she forgot about it . we tipped her very well because we could tell she was stressed out to the max but still friendly and doing the best she could . du par's needs to hire more staff to accommodate such big crowds !
this place was wonderful ! took my mother and sister here . 30 minute full massage for $ 15 , but we went for the full hour for $ 30 . best choice for us ! took us back in to a darker , calm section in the back , started with a foot soaking , then started at the head and worked down to feet , flipped us , then pulled some cirque du soleil magic crawling up our backs on their knees . totally amazing and would recommend this to anyone wanting a great massage at an even greater price !
the staff here is very friendly and professional . they went out of their way to make sure i found exactly what i needed and went above and beyond to ensure that i had the exact items i picked out for my delivery . they also have an incredible selection at this nursery and is the best you will find in arizona . i highly recommend working with this company . kevin , hunter , and austin provided the best customer experience i have had in a while .
it's a very cool place ! the building itself is beautiful and the market is an experience . i came here the first time thinking it was an actual farmer's market , so i was a little disappointed to find it is not it stocks produce that is unsold at area supermarkets . there are some locals selling maple sugar and the like . the meat is good and fresh , though , and i've never been unsatisfied with a purchase there .
went here for lunch last week . i had the loco moco which was huge and super yummy ! my friend had the fried poke which was also very yummy . staff was super friendly and provided quick service . restaurant was also clean .
i had high hopes for this place but it was very disappointing . i came here on a saturday afternoon and the place was full but they only had one waitress and one chef serving the entire restaurant . i think we waited about 45 minutes for her to clear all the dirty dishes off our table and then another 20 minutes to get our drink orders . the noise level was deafening ! my friend and i moved tables so we could hear each other , but it made little difference . it's a good thing i wasn't starving when i arrived because i might have lost it . by the time our orders arrived we had been waiting for over an hour and the food wasn't a consistent quality . the sushi was pretty good but the scallops were seriously overcooked and drowning in a sugary soy sauce concoction . the menu is miles long but it seems like they are trying to do too much . this area is very high demand and they are going to sink unless they hire more staff . the stairs to the bathroom should win an award for most likely to cause a fall and a broken neck .
the decorations inside of the restaurant was cute and lovely . their outside patio looked nice too but it was too hot to dine outside . my boyfriend and i came here for lunch . my boyfriend got the lunch special with caesar salad , the burger , and the brookie . i ordered the chicken sandwich with rainbow carrots on the side because i love me some rainbow carrots . i also ordered the white sangria which was very good . i love it . they had cute napkins that had the restaurants name on it . my chicken sandwich was really good . portion size is big so we had to take it home . my boyfriends burger was good too . i tried some of his caesar salad and it was delicious . i liked the croutons in it as well . the ice cream that came with the brookie was amazing . when it was time to pay they bring your receipt in this journal that allows you to write in it and so i took the opportunity to write michael and donna was here ! with the date on it . overall the food and drinks here are awesome and the restaurant inside was decorative and welcoming . definitely would try coming back for dinner here .
fresh does not focus an local nor organic food . just ask the waiter or waitress .
needed a smog to register my car , wasn't looking forward to waiting at dmv these guys hooked it up and i went to the gym . it was done before my workout was finished .
we still don't have air conditioning . when i called the office , they told us that we would have to wait until it got really hot outside . it's been 85 degrees in our apartment for some time . we can't open the windows because there's no screen and we don't feel safe having the windows open on the first floor in this area . this actually violates arizona tenants rights , but i guess they don't care about that . i highly recommend that you don't live here !
such a nice hotel ! we got a king room . bed and everything was spotless . hotel staff was friendly and helpful . would definitely stay here again .
this place is great ! everything about it . the employees , the casino , restaurants , gift shop , location , gym , hotel . just a great place with so many great things for all ages to choose to do from gambling to bowling to the movies . from steakhouse to burger joint . chinese to italian . you name your food combination and you can find it here . great valet services . wonderful view from my room . swift elevators . gargantuan bad ass suave gym facilities and oh shit . the pool ! i didn't get to go in it since i was working but from my window it looked like the bomb ! also they had a silent yoga one evening around the pool where everyone gets bad ass headphones and do yoga together there were hundreds of people and that's no shit ! i'd stay there again . by the way i scored a secret price deal on hotels . com's app and got a $ 79 per night rate , but don't forget the resort fee . i'll keep searching for my next stay .
absolutely zero complaints here . it was a perfect business trip . lobby and staff awesome ! rooms very clean and includes in room mini fridge and coffee maker . wifi was free . conference facilities very nice and comfortable . conference lunch was also awesome . lot's of restaurants and shops within walking distance . tell your friends about this place and it's awesomeness !
this place is one stop shopping . the have the best prices on almost anything . the deli is cool and the fried chicken that they make is very tasty . if you do not mind supporting a corporate giant who abuses overseas workers and their employees . by all means shop away !
it's been a few years since i stepped into a mikes but since i received a gift card , it allowed me to rediscover the chain . most mikes restaurants have undergone a makeover in recent months , they have a new logo and simplified menu that still focuses on pizza and pasta dishes . the place versailles location is no exception to this rule , the decor is very modern and suitable for a casual sit down with family or slightly more upscale business lunch . i love the red , white and grey color combos , everything looks clean and bright . there is even a bar and smaller , closed off room that is perfect for group events . i opted for the do it yourself duetto option which mixes a pasta and pizza of your choice , for around 12 $ it was very reasonably priced . i recommend the bruschetta rolls which are smaller pizza bites if you do not want a traditional pizza . these are fun and easy to eat as you can dip them in marinara sauce or drizzle the seasoning oils over them . my partner had a submarine which was generously sized , and upgraded for a meat sauce poutine that was a real knock out . the sauce is so flavorful and the mix of curd and parmesan cheese added to that extra savoriness . i noticed that the pasta dinner options are closer to the 20 $ range and feature many of the same mikes sauces that are widely available in grocery stores , therefore i'm not sure it would be worth it . they used to offer a great tortellini dish but this has now been removed from the menu . i would stick with pizzas , sandwiches or the duo options for lunch . great quality and value . bonuses free wifi , tv screens to follow sporting events , and free refills on fountain drinks .
i have to say that the vegetarian options here are the best that i have found in phoenix , maybe anywhere . this is due to the variety , creativity and boldness . i mean , to have vegetarian 'meat'loaf that is as good as it is . flawless . the only downsides are that the appetizers are a bit too expensive many cost more than entrees and it can get loud because the seating is a lot of freestanding tables versus some more booths and more intimate , divided spaces . but , those are picky and minimal when compared to the menu and draft choices . will be back . a lot .
show was really excellent so amazing the fact water and trapeze guy's all performance was a great experience price is fair for all the people is involved in the show and live band and singer i will definitely came back !
used to be a lot of fun , but prices went up and service went down . finding new place to hang out with friends !
deck seating during happy hour gets a big thumbs up from me . i personally prefer the frozen cosmo without chambord it's sweet enough . at three bucks during happy hour , i don't care that the frozen cosmo looks ultra girly pink . i also had an east end smoked beer , that was completely vegetarian , even though it might not have tasted that way . the food's decent here . the pasta in the macaroni and cheese was cooked perfectly not too mushy . the sauce was rich , though i might have liked some toasted breadcrumbs for a crunchy contrast . the bread that came with the spinach dip , though , was too hard . the food is more three star worthy , but the deck and happy hour drink specials bump the overall rating to four . i can't complain about the service here . they treated us fine even though we were a large group , and you know how large groups can be kind of pesky because we're not terribly coordinated when it comes to ordering and all that . they even gave us separate checks without complaint . the gratuity was already included , which was okay by me it's just a lot more convenient having my own bill instead of trying to figure out my share from one communal bill . gentlemen , i'm told the urinals in the men's room are interesting .
took 15 minutes of sitting in the drive thru to get my order and i was the only one in line so it obviously wasn't busy . also , i ordered a chicken , apple cranberry walnut chicken salad and ended up with no chicken disappointing .
this place was recommended to me from a friend and it did not disappoint ! i ordered an 8 inch round triple chocolate peanut butter cake for a birthday and it was delicious . the design on the cake came out 100x better than what i thought it would i mean i knew it would be great but not that great . overall , i am very impressed with the cake and service and will be back !
an excellent experience last night with wife , son and daughter . food was very good , reasonable prices , top notch service . i highly recommend this restaurant .
i have been coming here for over 2 months , and i have had nothing but great customer service . it has surpassed all expectations i had had . in addition to the lorena who has helped me in numerous occasions has handled in very professional manner . as well as provided detailed and informative answers to questions i had . i am very happy with this place ! very well kept facility , clean and very welcoming .
i agree if this place could get less than 1 star that's what i would give them for their service ! our server was horrible , this must be his first restaurant job cause he suck ! we went as a group last wednesday , it was a young guy with facial hair that was our server , he kept complaining that our group of 20 was to large he wouldn't be able to serve everyone for 45 min to an hour . he was so rude about 4 decided not to even order . this restaurant used to be so much better . to bad it sucks now .
altered my wedding dress to fit like a glove , with a quick turnaround ! everything was super easy ! highly recommend
ever wonder what it would be like to have stylist at golden rule salon color your hair and not do anything to rectify the situation . below is what you will get . this stylist completely burned my hair off with the bleach she let her assistant use without any supervision . this is a daily slap in the face . stay far away from this salon . or they will cause you to loose about half of your hair and consult an attorney for loss of hair by 50 . if your looking to get it burned go see brigitte .
went for a quick lunch with my ex colleague in the commerce court location . he ordered a grilled chicken burrito and i got a vegetarian bowl . a person ahead of us ordered a shrimp bowl . his bowl was over flowing and mine was not even half full . he paid the same amount as i did . the quality of the salad was just plain ok . the salsa had no flavour . added a hot sauce but it did revive it . according to my friend the chicken was bland as well . it was my first and last time .
the mussels were huge and the broth was out of this world ! the employees are as terrific as the food and the atmosphere ! menu wonderful ! loved it all employees engaging , enthusiastic , friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice experience . atmosphere cozy , warm , inviting ! love this place !
good coffee . good food . there was no wait for breakfast the sunday i went . the hostess was prompt to greet us and seat us . the server was friendly and got our order right . always a good sign ! i am adding this spot to my breakfast list .
decided to do drive thru on a sunday night . when i get to the window right away trouble started with them not knowing what i ordered ? umm seriously there was only one other car in front and you forgot my order ? so after reiterating what i wanted the kid said they where waiting on the bone i . chicken to cook and it should be a minute and to pull up . i waited and realized that 2 other customers have gotten food by now and i'm still waiting ? ! it's sucks when you go through a drive thru but have to get out to get your order . inside all the employees seemed lost as the manager had to deal with the delay of chicken orders . long store short 20mins after i order i get my chicken get home and realize they messed up the sides ! really . how freaking annoying ! welp will not be coming back to this location again .
when you have a debilitating meat craving and are stuck in vaughan's industrial wasteland , the sight of two cows atop a building may seem like a strange mirage . vincentia is a panino espresso bar , butcher and imported italian food store all in one . their delli section boasts a decent range of artisanal cured meats and cured sausages made in house . the panino selection is more modest . all the toppings have an additional $ 0 . 50 surcharge . as good as their steak panino was , i should have probably gone with the porchetta seeing as it is their signature sandwich . i will seriously consider their 10 lb porchetta roast for $ 100 when i'm expecting 20 people or so . all in all , a busy day of running errands quickly turned into enjoying a great lunch and watching the napoli v . milan game with a group of retired italians yelling at the tv nonstop .
im not like a huge fan of this place . but it ain't bad i recently fell in love with their 3 guys and i can't help but want to drink it all the time . p . s . this location doesn't have working wifi . been here two times and never ever got it to work like damn what's a girl gotta do to catch some pokemon near the area damn
came today for my brother birthday , everyone was great . food was awesome and service was top scale . austin was my server , greet guy . he needs a raise ! thanks . highly recommended
poor customer service and quality of work . the technician changed his story of what was needed 3 times when he was here . and i have been waiting weeks for a call back to have them return to fix issues with the poor quality work originally done .
probably the worst hotel on the strip . it has a decent location , but that's about it . the most annoying thing is their archaic policies you have to pay for wifi and you only get to connect two devices and it's $ 25 including access to their gym which no one ever uses . i mean , what hotel still charges for wifi in vegas ? i feel like i'm at some crappy airport hotel because i missed my flight . also , they charge you if you want to use the fridge , again , like the mini refrigerator was just invented and is some kind of rare , cutting edge innovation . there are also no ceiling lights or light switches which is kind of annoying only lamps which shows lazy and poor architectural design . overall , let's just say i'm glad i only had to stay here one night . i highly recommend finding somewhere else .
i'm not discrediting the other reviews but i , fortunately , had a very pleasant experience here . i filled out an inquiry online and was promptly called back to make my appointment . i was able to get a time and date that was convenient for me . the physician's assistance ester was a joy to speak with . she was a very positive person and in my opinion genuinely interested in helping me relieve my pain . i had to wait a while to see the doctor but after i made them aware that i was in a hurry they came to the room fairly quickly . the doctor was also very personable and as i understand wants to met every patient . the gals at the front desk were also very nice and helped me find an mri place that was located close to where i live . not that i want to be in pain for much longer , but i wouldn't mind having to go to a follow up visit .
don't waste your money on zarkana . i've seen other cirque du soleil shows and this is the worst of them all . the plot was incomprehensible , the flow of the entire thing was just off , there's too much going on on stage most of the time sensory overload ! , and the fact that it was in a theater as opposed to a circus tent somehow didn't feel right , probably because you don't get to appreciate the performers' skills in the same way .
meh . it was ok . i wasn't really impressed with this place . the food was ok and the service was ok , but it wasn't great . the location certainly isn't great . i may take my family to see what they think and update my review since it was just mediocre .
we stayed at red rock and sought out a dining option . my significant other expressed that the yardhouse was a welcomed option . we went on and found ourselves at the bar where we ordered food and drinks promptly . the service was fast and the food hot . however , the quality was less than favorable . the turkey burger was dry . very dry ! the appetizer , chicken wraps , was ground chicken that appeared to be grocery store packed worth no flavor . side sauces could be added but they lacked flavor as well . not to mention the cost was strip level $ 65 . 00 for 2 . casey , a male bartender , kept hiring on the girl next to us . he was using vulgar language like f bombs and s . my fiance called him out toward the end of the meal at which point he comped a drink and disappeared for the evening . my better half pointed out that if it weren't for shelby , the other bartender and only reason this is 2 stars , we would have walked out and made a scene in the process . never again yard house ! never !
i go here all the time . i like buying random books though . plus they are half price and they have a clearance section on top that . they also have cool little knick knack gadget stuff , which is always fun ! i don't find the staff to be particularly helpful but i'm able to find stuff on my own so it's not a big deal !
my husband and i decided to go to northside for my birthday dinner . yes , a lot of pressure on northside to give me that great meal . kc , our server , suggested the surf and turf . i could not have been happier . the steak melted in my mouth , the shrimp was tasty and my side of asparagus was wonderful . it was the perfect amount and very very good . my husband wasn't as crazy about his pasta with chicken but i gave it 5 stars because of the great service and my excellent meal . give it a try !
i went there at 1pm on a saturday and i was the only one there , and service was quick as a result . i got the 5 tenders , fries , toast , and sauce deal which was $ 8 . great deal in my opinion . tenders were fantastic . on par with cane's and popeyes . fries were good , not great . i'm a huge fries guy and i thought they could be better seasoned , but they certainly we're not bad . toast was meh . felt like wonder bread with garlic powder and butter . i understand that's basically all texas toast is but cane's pulls it off better . sauce tasted identical to cane's sauce . not my favorite , would have preferred some sort of bbq sauce . very creamy and mayo y , which is not too my tastes . overall there is some room for improvement but it's still a very good resturant for those of us on teamtendies .
i was excited to try out this new studio in lv . classes are not bad but i feel like most teachers are lacking enthusiasm . the ones i loved the most were deanna , patricia and jonathan . the other ones were a ok , especially the wednesday 6 30am that cannot can get the sequence right and always apologizes . i love 6 30 am classes and with only 3 available , i had to cut out wednesday because of that crappy instructor . too bad .
for late lunch on a saturday afternoon , a friend and former unlv student suggested stephano's . i loved that their menu had pictures as i am a visual person and i am horrible with food names . i had the rib eye steak shwarma combination that came with a side of fries . the shwarma was alright . the meat was a little on the dry side , but the other ingredients compensated for it . their fries are excellent ! i love crispy fries , and these were oh so crispy . they also have this cucumber dipping sauce that is really good with the pita bread . another thing that i must mention is that stephano's has a lot of different imported beers in their fridge . we tried at least 8 different beers , and they were around $ 3 bottle . they seriously have a lot of beer to choose from . we just stuck with the lower priced ones . as for the environment , stephano's was spacious , even on a saturday . a few people came in to smoke hookah in the back . they have space reserved for that . all in all , this is a cool place . i'll keep it in mind if i'm ever craving greek mediterranean in vegas .
stopped by today for a gel mani pedi today with my mom . what a wonderful salon , they have over 500 colors to choose from and even match their polish with gels of the same color . the whole staff was so friendly , would definitely recommend this salon !
came in with my husband and i had to listen to all the servers say they didn't want to serve us . yes we are a gay couple but to be passed up like that i just walked out .
this is a great place to grab a bite to eat either at lunch or for a casual dinner with friends . the menu has something to offer for everyone . take some time and explore the menu there are some hidden gems on there that you might overlook if you're not careful .
taste need improvement . a lot . not the worst hakka but not the best . taste should come alive dishes need to taste distinguished from each other . spice control is not where it should be ! there is a reason culinary world has 3 simple spice level mild , medium spicy . and cook needs to practice sticking with what spice level customers decide for their order . seating arrangement is better than ok . clean as well .
waited 20 minutes in this very smokey restaurant for one fruit cocktail while dozens of loud rowdy teenage boys played dominos and cards . and it wasn't even a cocktail like paramount has , it was just a strawberry and banana smoothie . and it wasn't even good . are they even allowed to have smoking indoors in mississauga ? save yourself the trouble , go to paramount unless you are looking for second or first hand lung cancer .
i am a mojito addict ! everywhere i go i like to try them to find the best one . and the mojito hut in vegas is by far a mojito to die for ! the original is always great . but the other flavors are so incredible it's nice to mix it up ! and let's not forget , the shots per drink are very very friendly servings . about 10 shots per drink . non stop pouring ! no measurements here . worth every penny in vegas . this is where you will get the most for you money ! i promise you won't be disappointed .
i love the couple that work here . they work really hard and their sushi is amazing . i generally don't eat in here , i usually order the take out . the quality of the fish is amazing and they usually take the freshness of the fish seriously . i would not go their with your children , there are no high chairs , and its a pretty small place . its quiet and quaint ! i love their handrolls ! as well , it is decently priced .
their customer service is terrible . they never answer , and their online booking doesn't work . it's unnecessarily difficult trying to book a simple appointment . basically it's a game of leaving messages and phone tag until you finally reach someone .
wow general exam and teeth cleaning was only $ 49 ! first time patient and what an awesome experience ! everyone who works there got a big smile to greet you with and did i mention everyone there is also good looking ? dr t dr brian were meticulous with their gentle touch ! vanessa at front desk is super nice and jackie dental tech was fabulous . see you all next visit !
i moved to charlotte earlier this year and tried lots of different gyms through class pass . previously my routine was made up of spin 3 times a week and weight lifting 2 3 times a week . madabolic has completely transformed how i workout . i get the cardio , weights , and intensity every single workout . the classes are challenging but the instructors are incredibly knowledgeable and supportive . in just 6 months i've felt my absolute strongest . if you want a gym with amazing people , kick ass instructors , and to get your ass kicked every single time . join . madabolic . your body will thank you !
service was okay . good ingredients , but food prep was meh . my husband and i shared the joe's special full $ 10 . 99 . the waitress let us substitute a biscuit and gravy for toast . the biscuit and gravy was okay , probably what i enjoyed the most . the scrambled eggs with underdone veggies which was sad because the ingredients had the makings of something special , but the sub par execution made us not want to order the dish again . the country fried potatoes were crispy but once again , the sauteed veggies were underdone . the potatoes were also under seasoned . this was our second visit . we love the location and how convenient it is . the portions were generous . we do not love the parking or the lack of spaces nearby . we also didn't care for how loud it was this time . if we do come again , we will ask to be seated out on the patio especially during the cool months . there isn't enough delicious breakfast places with nice ambiance .
this target never disappoints . great job to the whole team there everything i need and don't need but i leave with anyways is always in stock . their groceries are fresh and the team is friendly . my go to place if i ever need anything
i really like the henry for breakfast . having sampled a lot of las vegas spots for breakfast and not being a fan of casino lines and buffets , this is a good alternative for a quiet breakfast . the restaurant is located about as far as you can go from the front door of the main floor of the cosmopolitan hotel . next to the bond bar is the henry . the service is consistent . in other words , figure you are going to wait to sit , wait to order , wait to eat and the check will be slow . it's almost like they only hire folks with a 'tude , or who are horrible at customer service . generally , when i'm here with a group , we create a small pool to bet on how slow our service will be . however , the food is really good . fresh oj , great coffee drinks and lots of really good eggs dishes are their forte . the bloody mary is good , too , though liquid breakfast doesn't usually get it . if you want an option , eg sub fruit for potatoes , there's always an up charge . it almost seems like a game where they see what they can get from you . oh , you'd like an english muffin v toast ? that'll be $ 16 . 00 ! literally , the service is that bad . so , i give this 2 star service spot 4 stars due strictly to food and ambiance . if you want good service , denny's would be a better option . amusing place just to see how many times you'll hear upcharge .
came for a ton of street tacos gerson , our server , was awesome ! great service and the food margaritas were delicious . always a great happy hour special going on too !
what a fun place ! went here on a sunday morning and it was fabulous . we sat outside on the dog friendly patio with our dog . the brunch menu was delicious and had a table side mimosa bar . everything was delicious and reasonably priced especially the mimosa bar . definitely would recommend checking this place out !
i am very dissapointed in the management millennium properties who owns this building . camelot apartments has the potential to be a wonderful rental community however , the lack of internal upkeep has made this place uninhabitable . i moved in the end of june 2018 to move out the end of july 2018 due to the location being infested with cockroaches . my unit was not move in ready even though i paid a substantial amount of money there were multiple issues which were not handled in a professional or timely fashion . i also heard from my frusterated neighbors during my move out that they are dealing with bedbugs , which management is fully aware of both issues . they would rather blame , accuse , harass , threaten lawsuits , bully , add extra charges , and play mind games on their tenants , which happened to me personally instead of taking responsibility of their gross negligence to keep up the property ! do not expect your security deposit back ! here is my itemized list of things i had to throw out 1 . 32 inch flat screen tv 2 . queen size mattress , box spring , and frame 3 . 2 queen size comforters 4 . 2 tv stands 5 . 1 glass top desk 6 . 3 chairs 7 . 3 plastic bins 8 . 4 plastic drawers sets 9 . 1 wooden chest of drawers 10 . misc pots and pans 11 . all kitchen items 12 . microwave 13 . 2 book cases 14 . full size digital piano 15 . picture frames 16 . blue ray player 17 . glass top table 18 . fold up table 19 . phone and laptop charger 20 . 2 lamps 21 . am fm cd player 22 . 1 desktop double speaker 23 . 1 blutooth wireless speaker tower 24 . lotions , hair products , hair dryers , flat irons , curling irons , nail polish , ect 25 . framed artwork 26 . various nutritional supplements 27 . stacking cubes 28 . 2 clothes baskets 29 . 2 clothes irons with ironing board 30 . various art supplies 31 . vacuum cleaner just to make sure i didn't carry any pests with me . my $ 715 . 00 deposit sure could have helped me to start to replace these items ! worst rental experience ever !
a fine addition to north peoria ! went there for dinner two ordered the asian slamon , one ordered chicken cordon bleu house version and i ordered the ribs . all four said very , very good . only neg poor cole slaw , a vinegar sugar style and way too sweet . beer was excellent , drinks were very well poured . now serving breakfast on sat and sun and the menu looks yum . very cordial waitstaff . oh , the comment on pub grub . ribeye , cordon bleu , two versions of salmon one a special tonight , creme brulee and carrot cake both homemade , smoked st . louis ribs . pretty fine pub grub ! and on a tuesday night , a very good crowd you might want to check reservations on a weekend .
i'm originally from szechuan so i think i'm a fair judge of szechuan cuisine . most of the dishes here are authentically szechuan . what makes this place authentic is their red chili oil which is used in almost all hot dishes . in fact szechuan chili oil is not just chili and oil . it contains a mixture of different flavors extracted from spices herbs . some so called szechuan restaurants don't prepare the oil this way . but not this place ! i'm pretty sure chefs at szechuan prepare their red hot chili oil the traditional way because i can taste it and actually saw pieces of spices herbs in the food .
the crazy noodles and seaweed salad are great ! had good service and pretty great food ! couldn't ask for much more !
both of my vehicles have michelin tires purchased from discount tire . it is really nice to pay one price for tires that include lifetime rotation and balance . i use this store regularly for everything but it's nice that i can use the store up by my employment for rotation , balance and flat repair as needed . when it comes to price you will be hard pressed to find a cheaper price for brand named tires . had 2 tires replaced for free on my sport trac with replacement certificates and since tires were at the bottom end of their life i purchased two more to make it a set . no problems and even purchased certificates to replace these if it is needed . discount tire will continue to get my business .
amazing ! so many different option , gives you chipotle vibes . atmosphere is great and the workers .
my friend recommended me to this place and specifically to lisa . made a last minute appointment for today nye a few days ago and she had no problem acommodating me . showed her a few pics of the cut color i was going for and she surpassed my expectations . i feel fabulous and my hair looks amazing . she was so friendly and we were chitchatting away the whole time i was there . she definitely made me feel both important and comfortable . i am so happy right now and will be starting off 2017 on a positive note . thank you so much !
ohhh lady , i didnt order my honey oat as a flat bread ! but thats what i got ! small subway , hella ghetto workers , but what can you do ? my son and i love spinach and turkey subs so this is where we went after lvac . we were starving and of course they had their 5 $ footlongs . the place is in a funky location right across from starbucks . the parking hella sucks , but they do have a drive through and spinach ! we went in around 8ish and there was like 4 pieces of bread left . the one i got was flat and limp . kinda like others things ive had the girls working were like cholas and looked high , whatever just give me a yummy sandwich ! i had a simple one , she made it , and we left . the place was clean and they used gloves . ill def come back for a turkey with spinach on normal bread this time !
awesome place i love the combination 10 pho soup great broth , soft tripe and beef was excellent good job pho so
wandering horse is the best buffet in the phoenix area . considering that i'm not a huge buffet fan . i really love coming here . first of all the price for this buffet for breakfast is only 10 dollars . that is right i just said 10 dollars . it is a bargain for buffets normally buffets are at least 35 dollars or more . secondly everything at the buffet is fantastic . between the pancakes to the desserts , you can find some great things to eat at the buffet . last thing is that the waitress that always takes care of us does a great job at keeping our drinks filled and taking our plates away when we are done eating .
friendly service and comfortable setting . hasn't been crowded on any of our three visits during past month . consistently good food and value for the price . we appreciate the diversity it has helped add to the pinnacle peak restaurant scene . we will keep coming back .
staff is very accommodating , restaurant is clean and nice . food is good , not great , but nothing bad . gym is above average and accommodations are current .
great team appleone ! keep up the great effort to helping people like me find avenues for a great future .
had to have an exterior bib line installed to tie a mister system in . anthony was great to work with . he was on time , professional and gave me updates as he had them . moon valley was fair in pricing and will certainly use them again for our plumbing needs .
so i feel bad about leaving a not so nice review but hopefully this will help parents that are on a budget . so no joke to allow my kids to jump for two hours it cost $ 53 ! no food or anything else , that price was just to let my kids jump . guys i could buy a small trampoline for my backyard at that price . my kids had fun and that was nice but i went in after researching their prices online and thought i was going to spend around $ 25 but when i got there they gave me tons of excuses and all these little rules and it ended up being double the price . so went on a monday but they said just for today we are charging weekend prices also they said if you want your two kids to be allowed to play together you will have to pay two adult prices my kids are 4 and 8 and i guess my 8 year old needed an adult price which i still don't understand that and also my 4 year old needed an adult pass so that they could play together . if this all sounds like made up rules , i couldn't agree more . also the girl that rang me up was completely mono tone and didn't seem very confident in what she was telling me . my 4 year old is turning 5 this month and i was planning on doing his bday here but if it cost $ 53 for two kids for two hours than there is no way i can do a group of 10 15 kids . also if you want to help your younger kids while they are jumping they won't allow that unless you paid for a wrist band . all adults aren't charged at pump it up so you can help your younger kids if they are scared . which makes sense . sorry jump street there is zero logic in your pricing
this is one of those rare restaurants that everyone seems to enjoy including my wife and i . olivier was not manning the cash register , but mom was in the kitchen so all was well . we each ordered the vegetable quiche with a side salad that was nicely portioned and delicious . her coffee was super sized , refills not required though she did have them warm it up . since our last visit , the restaurant is now opening on weekends which is great news for locals not working the immediate area .
good indian place in food court . paneer butter masala and shahi paneer were awesome . naan is great . thali is not recommended , instead go for individual entree which includes rice and naan . gobi manchurian was disappointing . this place provides good service .
i own a commercial building that was converted into17 offices . mark has been instrumental in helping me balance the air flow between offices . he also installed additional a c runs that were necessary but overlooked by the original a c contractor . in addition , he installed 4 honeywell smart thermostats so that i have wireless capability to control the temperatures in the offices from any remote location . he is timely , does great work and has fair pricing . mark is as good as it gets . i'm a big fan of everest air and mark is your guy !
i had to take the time to give this place the credit and thanks that it truly deserves . city of the world puts on some great things and definitely helps to support the local artist in us all . i personally have been renting a spot monthly for first friday from city of the world and everyone that runs the gallery is truly very friendly and wants to do what they can to help you further your opportunities . one of the things i really like about this gallery is that when you walk around it you see many many different types of art , its not just one artist and one medium . not that individual showings are bad but i really enjoy the mix of pieces in the gallery . i would recommend taking the time to stop by the gallery and take a look around and to top it off , take a piece of the art on the walls home to help spice up your own place a bit all while helping out a local gallery and a local artist .
not a legitimate business . just a front for illegal activities and a lot of traffic including minors . just a terrible place ruining the area and depreciating properties . do not go there .
my friend has lived here for 7 years . loved it up until the new management . there were tons of maintenance issues she upgraded to a newer apartment . it literally takes months for them to fix stuff . and they forced her to board her animals to fix something and gave her no heads up . it's the middle of summer and the ac is broken . we've gone to the office 3 times to get someone to come look at it and still no one has come . what a terrible place to live .
my rating is based on customer service . i planned on purchasing a set of irons today . i inquired about the calloway xr xr os and wanted assistance in determining which irons would be best and a sales guy said i'm your man . many minutes later i was handed the calloway epic which i did not inquire about . i proceeded to hit 15 20 balls with no instruction or the opportunity to discuss the characteristics of the irons . the sales guy was obviously to busy with the other customer and did not have time for me it the thought of having someone else assist . as i'm standing there for a good 10 15 minutes he hands me the xr os and says see how this feels and proceeds to walk away again and work with the other customer . after hitting another 15 20 balls he's no where to be found . no one had the courtesy to assist or ask if i had any questions . as i'm walking out disgusted a sales guy asked if i needed help . i just kept walking out as it was too late after being in the store close to an hour . simply poor customer service . i was really looking forward to a new set of irons and improve my game . looks like another store will be getting my business .
we just bought a used vehicle from findlay and loved the experience . johnny in sales was knowledgeable , friendly and great to deal with . ty in finance made everything easy . overall , the best car buying experience we've ever had .
never fails ! i've used these services in the past and had a really positive , fun experience . decided to use them again this year for a larger group . there were 6 of us . sign up on the website was easy . we had to change plans a couple times and switching venues was easy as pie . confirmation emails were timely and clearly stated . we could basically go anywhere which was nice . we walked right up and got right in . no waiting in line and all that nonsense . we did at one point talk to a random on the street for our first night in town since we hadn't anything signed up with las vegas guest list and it ended up being wack . got sent to the back of a long line waited around and just decided to leave and go somewhere else . this was not the case for any of the places that last vegas guest list set up for us . i'll definitely use these services again . saved money , vip style access , best venues . thanks chris .
they have so many items to choose from the blue coconut is my favorite . it's not to far from my house and i go every week make sure to always get the tropical creme on your snow cone and ice cream on the bottom its worth the taste . they give you punch cards so the more you buy then the more hole punches you get towards a free bahama bucks and i love free . they have a surfer theme set up and most the drinks come with the umbrellas . the smoothies are very good as well i had the funky monkey and coco mel and it was delicous . great place for the kids they give each kid a snow ball to throw and they also have board games for the kids to play with and keep entertained . the service is wonderful . nothing to complain about and i will be back for more delicous creations .
excellent selection and service . loved the items i purchased here . chuck roast , philly steak meat , and sushi grade salmon were bought on a sunday and all devoured by the family . fresh , excellent product well worth the price .
as an indian desperately missing his cuisine , this was the first indian place i tried in tempe and boy was it wonderful ! completely satisfied my craving for indian food and left a lovely aftertaste in my mouth . the bill came up to $ 45 between the six of us and thats extreme value for money . and the dishes were authentically indian . the decor is like from some 60's bollywood movie but nothing u cant get over and eat . recommended
eat here for lunch . $ 9 lunch buffet , really amazing food , good service . i can't wait to go back .
we had a walk in party of 21 . started as just 5 but grew as more friends showed up . we figured we just have one big party . great food the wait staff was amazing , particularly tammy who had to deal with all of us for 2 hrs . if you are staying at the hotel they have coupons in your book when check in . use them we save over 300 with those coupons
very friendly and helpful place . the staff seem to be very knowledgeable and helpful . the only reason i give them 4 stars is they are on the expensive side for pet supplies
the food was really good , and i usually do 5 stars if the food is good and the service . however , the service was kind of mediocre . men that go alone will enjoy better service . ladies , never underestimate couples and families . lol ! you need tonsee money in all customers . i'm a pretty good tipper , so heed my advice . good chicken ! get your service straight . but don't chnage the recipes . lol !
i love the used dvd blue ray section . i find myself buying my movies from these guys about once a month . i love how these guys have they have up to date movies as well as gay themed movies which is great for the area they are located in .
came back in nov . 2016 and the music was very appropriate for a british esc pub . over the top union jacks and a picture of twiggy draws you in . once inside , they have a great staff and all the libations . the one problem is that the carpet doesn't match the drapes . if you're going to display british beauty , play appropriate music . cancon trag shit can kiss my ass .
have been coming to lapels for some time now . they always have the order ready on time and have had no issues with quality of work done or treatment from staff . my experience has been consistent and positive .
wonderful service and very affordable prices . i was able to get in the next day and i was in and out in an hour . i would highly recommend anyone needing their windows tinted to go there .
brixx has great food in a fabulous atmosphere . and the waitstaff is wonderful !
couldn't be happier . they fixed my smart tv in 2 days and the price is very good . most definitely recommend them to any one looking to get their tv repaired .
never have i witnessed such a corrupt and disorganized restaurant . came here for dim sum with family and friends on chinese new year and naturally there was a long line . but as i waited , i noticed customers who knew the staff , coming in after me , jumping the line and being seated . and even noticed some groups coming in , bribing the hostess , then promptly being given a table . only after we made several complaints to the hostess did she decide to give us a small table by the door . serve customers on a first come first serve basis , not through bribes and favoritism . very fair ? more like very disappointed .
went in for fingerprinting and was shocked at the lack of professionalism and knowledge about how they are to be done . it was my second time in a ups store getting fingerprints done . the first location i got prints done was in north phoenix and the manager did an amazing job rolling my fingerprints . she cleaned my fingers with water and rubbing alcohol then she personally rolled each of my fingers and they looked great . she even offered to redo them if dps rejected my application because of the prints . for my second fingerprinting i went to this ups location expecting the same treatment . the guy who helped me simply set up the ink , put my fingerprint card in the holder and told me to put your finger in the ink and press it on yourself . i was shocked and nervous . at this point i should have walked out and found a better place to get my fingerprints done , i regret not doing so . the fingerprints looked awful and no doubt will be rejected by dps . then he gave me a clorox wipe to clean my hands . aren't those for cleaning your kitchen and bathroom ? $ 15 spent for literally nothing .
kaya is an amazing restaurant , hands down my favourite dining experience when i was on my vacation in pittsburgh . it's tucked behind this . sketchy ish street where you can park your car along the street . we sat outdoors on a beautiful weekend . we ordered the jamaican jerk wings , ahi tuna poke bowl , and blue bay mussels . food came surprisingly fast , we didn't have to wait too long , considering all our dishes had a decent amount of meat in them . the ahi tuna poke bowl was amazing , fish tasted decently fresh , and everything else in the bowl complimented the tuna so well . mussels weren't too bad , nothing to complain about although , the portion was huge . we were sort of disappointed at the wings . the jamaican jerk flavour wasn't special in anyway , and it felt like the wings were a bit overcooked meat was dry and a bit on the tougher side . i remember ordering a margarita and it was amazing , but i couldn't find the drinks menu on their website .
phenomenal hamburger ! we were very lucky to find this place . with so many choices in las vegas , it is tricky to find good value . this is one of the best hamburgers i ever had .
pizza rock had a lot of buzz leading up to my visit and it lived up to the hype ! fantastic pizza and friendly service . i can't wait to visit again !
hey , this is really good food ! we ordered chana masala , navratan korma , malai kofta , naan , vegetable samosas , rice , and raita all prepared exquisitely .
first off , expect a long wait unless you're coming at weird times like the extremely early morning times . this is a 24 hour joint . there's only about 15 spots for patrons at the bar . during normal hours , expect about a 2 hour wait . also , this place is definitely not good for large parties , so look elsewhere if you are thinking about that . the item to get here is most definitely the pan roast . it's a tomato based stew that is cooked right in front of you , as all the soups are , in individual portions and topped over white rice . the stew is hearty and full of flavor . this really hit the spot . i also had oysters here , as it is the namesake of the bar . i thought they were just okay . good for vegas since it's so far from the ocean , but the quality of the oysters is far below those of cities near the sea , such as those i've had in boston , sf , and seattle . again , get the pan roast !
perfect , we missed the breakfast time but still wanted to try everything on the lunch menu . if i come back to visit montreal i will definitely stop by again .
the coffee always tastes perfect , the staff is very friendly , and the service always fast . everything i need from a coffee shop .
first time to th . they expected me to understand some standard th things like sugar , cream serving amounts , how to get utensils that i was unaware of . probably speedy service normally but a bit clumsy help if you've never been to th before . breakfast and coffee were good .
hands down the worst hotel on the island , like i would rather sleep next to homeless person on a cardboard box before stepping back into that box .
this is the first time that i've been to this location , usually i go to the meadowvale location . the food , as always was good , we got the tuesday special $ 0 . 75 wings , roasted garlic mushrooms my personal favourite and the garden crasher . our server wasn't very attentive my drink was never refilled and we weren't asked if we needed anything . our food came all at once , we are used to apps coming before the wings so it cluttered the table . all in all you can't really go wrong with wings and apps , but service is what makes me come back and i find it better at another location .
i've been coming here for quite some time since i live close by . they recently underwent renovation which resulted in an increase in prices and i , as a long time customer , find that a bit frustrating . like any other shisha place , they offer different kinds of heads and add ons to customize your shisha according to your taste . i recommend getting the orange head because it is stronger than a regular head , tastes better , and lasts much longer so you can enjoy your stay there . on the down side , they only serve bottled water instead of tap water and i highly suggest purchasing any other beverage since you'll be paying anyways . besides beverages , their menu does contain various types of dishes if you are feeling hungry . the decor is super chills and they have these comfy booths you can sit at if you are a group of 4 or more people . the playlist always gets the mood going , except when they turn up the volume and you can no longer hear what your friends are saying which never fails to get me wondering why they don't serve alcohol . free wifi and friendly staff but the service is slow at times . make sure you don't go super late cause then you will have to wait to be seated and that's never fun .
the chairs upholstery was filthy and dirty . the samosa was very greasy . the food was awful . tasted bland and the panner was rubbery . very disappointed with this place .
i love this place ! i prefer a male , they tend to offer better pressure . this is a reflexology massage . your feet soak whilst they massage your head face . focusing on the pressure points . they will leave the room to get hot towels and remove the foot soak . it you will still get the full massage . i have never had a bad experience in over 20 visits . my teenagers love it also . you can . it beat the price !
incredibly pleasant surprise finding this gem owned by a chef who was on iron chef . the menu was a great balance between seafood i love and non seafood which my wife loves . i initially chose this restaurant just for the grilled caesar which was better than i thought it could be . when our waiter keith offered to give me a half portion of the lobster gnocchi and a 1 2 portion of the squid ink pasta instead of making me choose , i fell in love with the place . only thing better than that service was the taste of those two dishes which were incredible ! oh , the molten chocolate cake we had with salted caramel sauce topped this dinner off in a way i couldn't imagine . go have a great dinner at tarbell's !
good food , very solid . nice , dim interior would make for a great , cozy place to go in the winter . macrons are buttery and unique . not a great place from a parking stand point , but otherwise , very respectable indeed .
dr , heather has been my chiropractor for almost three years . she is fabulous ! besides being very knowledgeable , she listens to my concerns and addresses them with care . i highly recommend dr . heather ! in addition , if you're looking for a great neuromuscular massage therapist , i recommend crystal . wow ! crystal gets right to the source of my pain and helps to alleviate it ! i can't say enough great things about dr . heather and crystal !
after a night out at hakkasan , we headed back to our hotel , the venetian . before going to bed , we wanted a meal and stopped by grand lux . it was already 3am and there were very few customers . yet it took forever to get a few mediocre burgers . not sure what the hold up was since we weren't asking for anything special . the entire meal was uninspired and time consuming . if you're hungry in the middle of the night , i suggest that you go somewhere else .
lazy dog is a great place . the staff is attentive , there is a bar with tvs turned to sports , and there is an outdoor patio where your pup can hang out . the architecture is beautiful and the ambiance is family oriented . their food portions are large and the food is very good . the thai salad was excellent . would have given it 5 stars except it gets really busy and noisy inside so tough to have conversations . overall , a great place to go .
i stopped in here for a drink while out with friends and the place was packed . we ended up having to stand which was fine . the atmosphere is just that of a regular bar but they had a great outdoor seating area that looked like it would be great in the summer , it also had another bar out there . it has a lot of tv's and it seemed like a lot of people were watching sports but it wasn't the kind of place that you had to . hopefully next time we give it a try we can get a table !
ihor and dave durrill great people to work with . bought 2 vehicles last year and they went above and beyond to get us a great deal !
this is my favourite burger place in the usa . i'm on a diet right now so i was unable to try the double double burger . so instead i just got a regular hamburger fries and a lemonade . i managed to stay within my diet and enjoy the most delicious burger i've ever had . this location , like every other one i've been to , is incredibly busy . however , because of the limited , simple menu , they are very fast and efficient . i still had to wait about 10 minutes but there was probably 30 people ahead of me . not bad ! one thing that really impressed me about this place is how hygienic everything is . the staff is always running around cleaning things and if anything hits the floor , straight to the garbage ! the atmosphere reminds me of a 1950s diner . if you've never been here before , give yourself a treat and try it .
yes it gets busy and there is a wait however the customer service is fantastic and the food is wonderful . of course i have my favorites but i've never tried something and not liked it .
my local greasy spoon . i love the milkshakes here . breakfast and lunch food has all been good as well . i've never ordered anything to be disappointed . i tend to go for sandwiches and burgers for lunch , but the chicken chimichurri kabob are out of the world and i have had it at least a half dozen times . breakfast wise chilaquiles , any of the omelettes , or the breakfast burrito will treat you right . service is good , and the current check in offer of bottomless coffee will get you well caffeinated if you find yourself in need .
we used to love this place but it's slowly going down hill . perhaps they are just getting too greedy . i ordered my go to , a meatball sandwich , the other night with extra sauce on the side . i noticed that the total was more than usual and when i looked at the check i saw they charged $ 2 for an extra side of sauce that they didn't even bother to put in the bag . when i returned to request the sauce that i had paid for , the gave me a very very small container . when i made a comment about the size the lady lied and said they also added extra sauce to the actual sandwich , which they did not . i understand policies change but at the very least the person taking my order could have let me know about the price increase . its only $ 2 but that's not the point . it's just disappointing when perfectly good restaurants stop caring about customer satisfaction and begins worrying more about the bottom line . if they are so worried about making a few extra bucks on some sauce , it makes me concerned that perhaps they are also cutting corners with the quality of ingredients in their kitchen .
it was an experience in narcissism . i didn't need the whole historical origin story of criss angel , and i didn't need to see video screens playing content that was a decade old or more . the on stage magic is very outdated and from my seat , i could see the black drapes in the back and see how the magic was being done they try to use smoke , bangs and flashes and sharp noises to help distract you but in the end , it's just a very mediocre performance . the 1st large trick is with several doves , criss makes them appear out of thin air , one after another after another after they appear , they fly onto a prop tree , and kudos to the stage hand helping guide the birds get onto the prop tree , once full , they fly out and over the audience , in fact , those birds were quite fabulous , he does a bit with quarters but they are using a terrible vhs quality camcorder so from the balcony on the other side of the theater you have to watch the screens and it's just . why isn't he doing this on stage with a hi quality video camera ? there is a point in the show where he becomes like a zombie demon but i wasn't into it , but i did laugh when a woman volunteer snogged him during his act , he totally kissed her back , that was the best part of the show . the 2nd biggest trick he does the whole night is saw a woman in half which is super depressing because it's old old old , and had no wow factor , just more loud noise and flashing lights at one point it looked like a prop being pulled apart . it's cirque and i was expecting a contortionist to come down from the saw and at least make it look like she was moving and not just stuck in one spot , but for me the magic was dated , i felt like i was watching believe on the old spike tv network . simply put , this show as not better as a live show
thank you to everyone who has yelped about this show . i don't know if i would have noticed it without yelp . this show was perfect . great performers , funny acts , and not a bad seat in the place . get there about 45mins early , grab a drink , and get in line . i don't think you have to buy vip to be happy . it's general admission , so you pick where you go . the front row will be messed with , so choose seating carefully . don't go if you can't handle dirty jokes . seriously though , go . it's fantastic , and you will laugh so hard it hurts .
haven't even got food yet and i was a little disappointed on first impressions . the brunch did not look good . dirty display of food . also they were out of a few items on the menu . all of the seats in all the booths appeared to be badly stained . half the booths had tables 2 foot shorter than the benches . all the small plates were in dishwasher . even if the food is five stars , which it is , they start your experience out a little rough . this was at 1 30 sunday
if this were a review for the staff , it would be at least a four . unfortunately the other attributes of the tropicana drive my enjoyment of this hotel down significantly . in addition to the usual vegas hotel nonsense of being unable to go anywhere in the hotel without walking through the casino floor , the tropicana is much in need of some deferred maintenance . the bathroom in particular , appears quite worn and the tub is cracked and peeling . the bathroom fan is on an old fashioned timer system that barely works , and the lights above the sink have no obvious switch . much of the wooden furniture in our room displays the same kind of wear , and the walls are thin enough that noise outside the room , including other rooms pipes , can be bothersome . the hdmi input on the tv is locked out . hard water , too . not impressive .
i went to this location because they had a cheap oilchange . i have my car reularily checkd and servied with my mechanic . meineke said i needed lots of work and ried to conince me . i did not proceed wih work . dont think ill return .
cute bubble tea joint with a few small booths to sit down at , but seems like more of a takeout place . loved the colours and cute little heart toppers that comes with their drink . their sakura sparkling water was surprisingly very tasty ! would come back in the future to sit down and try their desserts as well .
i am a bit of a coffee snob so when i say that i probably had the best cappuccino ever take heed ! the atmosphere is fine , the staff are friendly and attentive but the quality of the coffee is great and value for money , second cup is less expensive than all the other st catherine cafes . enjoy
the menu can be a bit hit and miss , but the red curry chicken with a side of coconut rice is amazing ! the chicken is fresh , and plentiful . i usually substitute the long bean for bamboo shoots to add a little extra flavour and texture . the downfall is the delivery time . you can expect your foid to arrive 60 minutes from your order .
went here three times this week for lunch and dinner . lunch specials on weekdays are a very good deal . lots to choose from . most noodles and entrees under $ 10 , comes with drink and are delicious . we had the spicy beef brisket soup noodle , black pepper chicken steak with rice , portuguese chicken rice for lunch . portions were huge and food came super fast . we were able to box half our portions for home . staff is also efficient and friendly . weekend lunch special menu is limited but still lots to choose from . for dinner , we had peking duck and lobster dinner set . once again , food came quickly and was very tasty . like that we were able to reserve a table since kenny's is always packed . only downside is they no longer give free dessert for dinner . but you can still get free red bean drink for pm tea . every hk diner has raised their prices at least 2x this year but kenny's still best for taste , portion and value .
the cross creek inn has always been a local favorite . nothing fancy , but good food and great service . the wings are real whole wings done perfectly . prices are very reasonable . i would recommend cross creek to anyone looking for a good meal in elizabeth .
worst experience ever ! i made an appointment with sandee because the site said she has 20 years experience and a specialist in color . i went in with hair color similar to reese witherspoon and left looking like kelly bundy ! first time i've ever cries in a salon chair . she suggested i brush my hair a certain way to cover it up . her words , not mine . she literally sent me home with foils still in my hair her third attempt to fix the odd color and with wet hair i drove 40 minutes crying the whole way . save your money and go elsewhere !
i highly recommend skin by jessica to all . jessica is knowledgeable , professional and does an awesome job . they do not come any better then this lady and i promise you , you will not be disappointed !
the service was good waitress was great , ice ice cold beer , however on 7 31 17 went there with family and dinned in . i ordered the fish and chips which is always a favorite . this time i am not so sure . i ate the fish which seemed to be fine , one i tried to enjoy the frys with tartar sauce something did not seem right . i could not eat any more and began to feel sick . we talked for another 10 minutes and i had to vomit ! yes , i ran to the bathroom and stayed like this all the way home . it was not until i ate the tartar sauce . did i feel . not sure if it was sitting out but i was sick the rest of the night . not happy at all . always been a loyal customer but with the increase to start and now this i may have to rethink goinf back find another place to watch my aports . i used to love it but the fish portions were small fries were soggy and tatar sauce spoiled or out dated !
no star should be given . ordered a large pepperoni pizza , two large dinner salads and the sampler appetizers . put order in at 8 15pm , was told it would be delivered in 45 minutes . we received the food 9 45pm . the pizza was cold with grease that had already started drying on top . appetizer was placed on bottom of bag which made one of the salads warm . appetizers were luke warm , ordered 4 dressings for the salads , received 2 sour blue cheese dressings . called immediately and was told to call in the morning . called 10 00am like i was told never was told to keep the food of course manager was not in 10 00 , was told to call back at 5 00pm . i had a plane to catch , so went in 1 45pm and was told they would only give me $ 10 . 00 back . what ? the gal told me what if we had to refund everyone again , what ? i paid $ 50 . 00 dollars for inedible food . the gal also said , we need to see the food . what ? it's in the garbage . worst food ever and by far the worst customer service ever .
our first cuban try in vegas and we weren't disappointed ! easy to find location . cute interior . nice latin music . we tried the green plantains and combo ceviche for starters . plantains were piping hot with a butter garlic sauce . the ceviche has a mayo dressing . different but super good . huge chunks of ceviche . gotta add the hot sauce for a little kick ! can't decide on a main dish . ? try the sampler like us ! it was all wonderful . the rice and beans a perfect combo to the spicy meat . oh and the gratis cuban bread . so good and buttery ! perfect place for a large group or intimate dinner ! definitely will be back ! i want to try a specialty drink next time !
the restaurant is super cute and i love the ambience here . the service is very good , though some might consider it slow but it's a small restaurant and isn't too busy , so i think it's fine . the food selection is nice , they have salads , wood fired pizza , wraps and other dishes . definitely a cute restaurant closer to home
i don't prefer to stay here . instead i enjoy it solely for the botanical gardens . even though you're obviously going to be swamped with tourists i mean what part of downtown vegas isn't going to be ? but surprisingly enough it was actually peaceful . one of the few places we really didn't want to leave from ! lol
it's a great low key place . the fruit juices are fresh , and the fish is fantastic . you can even get whole tilapia fish , which is a rare find in madison . there are also fired plantains available ! menu is not overwhelming and really reasonably priced .
came back and the food was even better ! everything comes out so quickly and is served piping hot be careful with the egg rolls and shrimp i burnt my tongue . service was great as always
big eez fans at our house . is it the best sushi ever ? no . but its consistently good with a nice selection of nigiri , rolls , etc . even a make your own choice . it is a little pricey as other reviewers have noted and that may be the one thing keeping this review at 4 stars . the rest of the menu is solid and changes up relatively frequently to keep things interesting . love the design your own noodle bowls with your choice of noodles , sauce , veggies , proteins . a new lunchtime offering of fish tacos are well done and frigging huge . two giant tacos filled with crispy fish , napa cabbage and finished with a delicious cilantro sriracha cream sauce . plan to share with a friend . lastly , my wife would not forgive me if i didn't mention the thai cucumber appetizer . sweet , tangy , yummy heat . we bring them home to use as sides at least 2x week .
gosh , this is a challenging one . i really wanted to love this place but am not sure i would return . they list gluten free options and that is hugely attractive to me . the bean thread noodle salad was good although the shrimp in it was like eating a rubber eraser which is better than a bad shrimp but not great . the summer rolls were pretty good although the chicken was kind of dry and the shrimp while not quite rubber eraserery had very little taste to it . the other ingredients in them were good and fresh . the hoisin sauce was really good . i also had some panang chicken . the panang was very different from other panang sauces i've had mostly in seattle and i didn't really like it . i got the gf some pad thai . it also seemed really different . i had asked if it had a tamarind based sauce and was told that yes it did but it didn't taste like a tamarind based sauce to me . unfortunately , the food all made my stomach make weird noises . which was not awesome . since we did take out , i can't comment on the service .
got to the airport at 0105 and there was no shuttle . tried calling sixt several times and no answer . we walked over with our children in the freezing cold while dragging our luggage . there was a very long line , 1 customer service rep along with 2 other workers . apparently , 5 other workers called in sick so these 3 individuals were overwhelmed trying to assist everyone as best as they could . several customers prior to us could not find their cars . come to find out , the cars were in another lot that the workers could not get to . they finally figured out how to get the cars from the other lot . we finally got to the counter at 230am . my husband was sent to look for the car , but of course it was in the other lot . we waited patiently until they could retrieve it for us . we finally left at 330am . the workers there were amazing and did everything they could to assist us , however i think that management should look at process improvements . it's absurd to be traveling for a long period of time , exhausted , then having to bare the cold with young children having to walk over to the sixt location while dragging luggage and having to wait hours for a rental car .
this place is simply okay . it's not great , but i'm not upset that i tried it . i considered giving it two stars , because they completely forgot to give me the smoothy i ordered . i had to go back and ask for it , and then still had to wait a while to get it . i was almost done eating my meal by the time i finally got the drink . i decided to settle on three stars , because the salad was pretty good and the restaurant was decorated nicely . the have a pretty wide selection which is nice , and the portions are fairly large . the pricing is a little high , especially considering there is no table service . the selections are all pretty standard , and i wouldn't say that there is anything special about rachel's kitchen . it's a very average restaurant with okay food .
fish tacos are oh so amazing ! i have to eat here at least once a week . the food is fresh . the prices are fair . the guys are great . everything i've tried has been excellent ! i love the habanero salsa too nice and hot ! look , some people complain that they wait too long for their food to be prepared . if you want fast food then try burger king down the road . i'll wait 10 minutes for my fresh food . as far as service . they are all so friendly ! i always have a great time here !
veronica has been our insurance agent for years . she's always available to actually speak with us anytime we need anything . she also takes the time to explain everything to us as well . i would definitely recommend veronica to help you with your insurance needs !
the waiting wasn't bad for a valentine's day crowd . the rib eye and the fillet mignon were excellently cooked to preferences . the best asparagus i've ever had , it melts in your mouth . service was top notch and our server was spot on . their new york cheesecake was better than most new york restaurants . overall , i will recommend this place .
ordered a beef shawarma from skipthedishes , paid $ 1 . 50 extra for garlic sauce and no onions . to my utter disappointment i was given a shawarma with extra onions , barely any garlic sauce and extremely spicy . it was bland and spicy , not worth spending money and ultimately threw it away .
pho linh is a very respectable vietnamese restaurant in the keele steeles area . i can see myself coming back here if i'm not willing to make the trip to the jane weston and finch area aka the mecca of the toronto pho scene . pho linh is traditional , authentic , and like most pho restaurants , very reasonably priced . one thing my pho cohorts 'pho horts' , if you will and i noticed is that the broth is noticeably less saltier than other comparable vietnamese joints . if you're watching your blood pressure but craving some vietnamese noodle soup , pho linh is the place to go .
probably one of the best steaks in las vegas . comfortable seating and busy . very busy . lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little , but delicious amount you got . for a new restuarant the staff was very well trained . looking forward to next visit , minus lobster app .
went there for a late lunch today . seated quickly and friendly . drink and food orders taken quickly . from the minute our waters were delivered to the table our waitress did not stop back to check on us besides one water refill for about 45 minutes . never an update on the food . never an offer to get a drink or an appetizer . food arrives from a food runner or fellow waitress about an hour and ten minutes after order . mind you the restaurant was not busy . my wrap was completely doo doo . it didn't stay together and was luke warm . it was one of the most doo doo wraps i've ever been served . it came with luke warm waffle fries as well . anything but hot crunchy fries equals certified doo doo . my girlfriend ordered an apple cider margarita when the food arrived . her food was cold by the way . she ordered no salt or sugar on the rim . guess what the rim had on it . doo doo . in summation this is my 4th visit to this location . out of all of the locations in the pittsburgh area this one is by far the most doo doo . ps today i left a 41 cent tip . happy new year . doo doo .
i just love lux . it is one of those places that is an iconoclastic phoenix gem . the wonderful teas , coffees , yummy eats , fabulous music and eclectic crowd make it this the best spot in town . i do wish they did a few more gluten free treats
spare yourself a headache find another bike shop ! took my bike there for repair to have a wheel trued , work not done correctly , many of the spokes were left so loose they were literally flapping in the wind i could tighten them with my bare fingers , also found the hole for mounting the rear rack had been stripped the rack was also flapping in the wind . took the bike back to the store , waited to speak to the owner who told me that spokes left this loose in perfectly normal i should do my own research and that their tech overtightening stripping the hole for mounting the rear rack was somehow my fault . i was absolutely shocked appalled that a business owner would be so rude , condescending , accusing obnoxious , with anyone , especially a long term 15 year customer who has bought 6 bikes there . i did the research , could not find a single source confirming that spokes should be left extremely loose , every wheel trueing guide from any source states that there should be at least some tension on all spokes so obviously i was being lied to . i will be trying a few other bike shops closer to home where i can walk instead of driving my car putting up with the parking hassles on danforth . cyclepath not only doesn't seem to know what they're doing in bicycle repair , the owner manager obviously doesn't have the first clue regarding customer service , public relations , basic politeness manners , it's truly a wonder how they've stayed in business this long .
great sandwiches ! in our quest for something good to eat while out of town , i decided on wolfgang puck's bar and grill . we headed on down to the mgm and walked around for a while before finding it . it was a friday just before noon , so it was a little early , and we were seated right away . we took one look at the menu and both knew exactly what we were having . i started with a raspberry lemon drop martini and he started with a coors light . i got a cuban sandwich and my dining companion got a roast beef panini . both came with homemade potato chips . the atmosphere was comfortable and casual , yet very appealing and not loud for being in the middle of the casino . the food came rather quickly , just as the place was starting to fill up . the sandwiches were great ! my cuban had the right amount of everything , including pickles on the side so i could add more . i typically do not care for homemade potato chips apparently these were the exception . dining companion really enjoyed his roast beef . the arugula was a nice touch to the sandwich . overall a great meal . i would go back without hesitation . in and out in under an hour . the food great , the service spot on without being annoying and the price fair at $ 50 for everything plus tip .
came here for the first time last night , i'm not going to lie i had a pretty good buzz going before i even showed up but everyone working was sooooo nice , friendly waitress , cool bar staff , nice door man . the bar was full so we grabbed a table and i got a greek salad which was delicious , we ordered a couple drinks and when a spot at the bar opened up we moved over . we had help from stevo who helped us get a little more drunk and even offered to get us a ride home if we got too drunk .
i recently wanted a simple job a oil painting to be matted and placed in an ikea frame . 2 other framing shops said it'd cost $ 150 to do it , and i was actually on my way to one . but since syllogy was on the way , i decided to drop by and get a quote . the lovely lady in charge explained that an oil painting could not be framed under glass since oil needs to breathe . which the other shops had failed to explain , and probably would have cost me in the long run , as mildew would have developed . i then went with a full framing job by her , at a very reasonable price . a week later , i dropped by on request and she suggested a different frame , since it always appears different once the painting is stretched . this shows a level of service and respect for the customer . she simply could have completed the job but i really appreciate her going the extra mile for the customer . when the job was delivered , the work was immaculate . it's now my favorite framing shop and i highly recommend it to anyone else in toronto .
i am embarrassed to admit that i actually like pf changs . a lot . chinese food is generally too greasy for me , but this actually tastes healthy . plus , i could drink the sauce that comes with the lettuce peanut wraps , i think it's so tasty .
tired of stale , chain bookstores ? restless in your community library ? you may want to visit changing hands . especially if you like unusual gifts or novelty type items . aside from the ample inventory of books , you will find such whimsical gifts . i mean , where else can you buy cat butt gum ? or antibacterial gel for ocd ? tabasco flavored chocolates ? have some poltergeist haunting your crib ? well , this place has various sage for purchase so that one may cleanse their dwelling of bad vibes spirits , etc . and , of course , they have incense sticks cones and other hippy stuff like homemade soaps , essential oils , blah blah blah . they also have a full coffee bar towards the back of the store , to amp up while looking at 100 ways to make a cat like you , or what your poop actually means . pure genius . ps they're also neighbors with southern rail restaurant offering southern food as well as a bar w karaoke . about a block away from one of the light rail stops . take the train and be cool , like i did .
this was a great show . i see a lot of shows and i really loved donny and marie . it really made my whole vacation . i didn't grow up with donny and marie but i'm now big fans . it was a fun high energy evening . i can highly recommend this show to everyone ! i don't yelp many things but i felt compelled to do this review after the amazing performance .
this place will take you back home . best cornbread i eve had . and is by my house , am in trouble . felt like i was in jacksonville , florida .
this place is another great dive bar on the strip in pittsburgh . the penn pumpkin roll is amazing , but make sure you ask for the cinnamon and sugar around the rim . also they have a beer called sprecher , hard root beer , and it tastes just like root beer , awesome . there is also an upstairs for extra room and a great view .
convenient place to grab a drink after a diamondbacks game , which is why we ended up there . the service was painfully slow they were constantly hurrying us to close out .
if you're looking for something cheap and decent , this place isn't bad . we ordered fried tofu , calamari , duck curry , salmon avocado curry , chicken noodles . we all asked for medium spicy and most of our food wasn't spicy at all except for the noodles which was really spicy my friend looked like he was in a hot yoga class while eating it , i personal tried it and it was on the very spicy side we had to add rice to it and even with that , it was still very spicy .
if this is your only option it is adequate . bring something for the kids to do because you will be waiting for a long time . the staff is nice but not well trained and seemed short of basic supplies . our dentist was good but obviously overworked and rushed through exams . when you have medicaid , badger care or nothing you know how hard it is to find a dentist . i'm just grateful that my kids finally had a checkup and thank the staff for treating us with care and respect .
i haven't had a positive dental experience since i left erie and moved to pittsburgh . i have to say thank you cynthia labriola for making me excited to go to the dentist again ! i was referred to this dentist by a friend that swore that she was the best . i had my doubts since i loved my dentist back home . i was mistaken for sure . the front desk people are incredibly friendly and personable . they asked me a few times how to say my name correctly because they wanted to make sure they pronounced it right , that meant a lot to me . they laughed with me when i told them i wanted to make my next appointment later than 8 am , and told me about them trying to drag themselves into work . it was just so friendly that i enjoyed my checking in and checking out experience my hygienist theresa is amazing . boy , when she told me she was going to really scrap my teeth , she really did scrap , and my teeth looked amazing . she was friendly , talkative , and informative about the new x rays machine that they were using . i wouldn't change her for the world ! a great office , a great location to me , i would recommend this dentist to everyone ! looking forward to going back there in october !
i got the sampler plate with 2 ribs , pulled pork , and smoked turkey , blue cheese slaw and mac and cheese and corn bread . first the good the ribs are delicious , not especially tender more on the firm side , but pleasantly so and very tangy . not a lot of smoke flavor , very sweet , but still a treat . best part of the meal . the turkey was good too , not amazing . the pulled pork was a bit confusing . every bite tasted different , some good , some quite nasty . the slaw was very good , not much bleu cheese flavor , but not overly creamy , nice and tangy and crisp . the mac and cheese was a disappointment . it's rare that i don't love any version of mac and cheese , so that's saying a lot . it was grainy , mealy , with odd flavors . even the bacon sprinkles on top didn't salvage it . the corn bread was good , almost like a cake , in that it was spongy and very sweet . i ate it as a dessert , basically . i enjoyed my meal basically , but given how amazing great barbecue can be , there's a lot of room for improvement here . there's too much sweetness overall , not enough smoky savory flavors . service was fine , though the line to get a drink at the fountain was often very long . a place like this needs more than just the one fountain .
stopped here for a quick bite and we were not disappointed . the bat or blt was freaking awesome . thick bacon and the fried tomato and dressing brought it all together . the fried chicken had a glaze on it that was amazing . i would highly recommend this place and i would even go out of my way to eat here .
this is a reasonably priced place to grab some authentic new york style pizza . the ingredients are fresh and tasty without adding a bunch of spices to hide a bad sauce . the best authentic pie shop in rock hill thus far .
amazing ! this hotel is all around amazing . from the moment you get off of the cab shuttle car your are living the vegas experience . located in the center of the strip , easy access to other attractions . nice big lobby filled with flowers and lots of plants . they have a small mall lv , armani , chanel , high end stores located within the mall . i have been here twice and the first time i went we got a room that was beautiful . i man everything was wood , huge bathroom with marble floors , super nice comfy beds . the second time we had a nice room also , but different . it was smaller and the furniture was just average . the rates are a bit on the higher end , but it is a nice hotel . worth it , i would recommend this hotel .
decided to make arizona my home for now . stayed here for about 3 months waiting on my pay stubs so i could rent a place . awesome stay really quite it was nice watching the cars go by on the free way and the little bunnies out back in the desert running around very peaceful felt like i was on a retreat from life . if i ever need to stat at another hotel in arizona i will definitely stay here again .
the search is over ! after reading the untouchable yelp reviews , i booked a cut with kelly , and i've never had a better haircut . if you're male and you have hair , you should just go here and be done with it .
guess what ? they don't deliver until 5pm . after filtering our search for delivery , this is the third pizza place that yelp info has gotten wrong , we are now frustrated ! just wanted to order pizza for delivery by the pool at legacy resort and get pm with our day .
i called and left one message in the morning and then one just before noon . both calls the answering system said she was with a patient and they would call back . i left full messages with symptoms and return phone number also stating my availability was open to any open time . it is now 2 days later after work hours and i have not received a return call not even a message . don't bother with this group . it appears that they are not interested in new patients at all .
dont use ! completely useless staff . your are better sending or receiving your items by carrier pigeon ! hours of business . when they feel like turning up . heaven forbid you use purolator or get redirected here . if you turn up twice when they say they are open and they don't bother turning up it will cost you $ 20 ! also note that your packages are not safe due to the upstairs apartment tenant is allowed to roam in the store whenever she wants ! trust me she even opened the front door to me . ! ps . had to give them one star to post . they should have negative stars too . if so they get the limited amount !
so i ordered up a grand marnier after a recent cavs playoff game . i had finished the drink only to discover that there was lipstick on my glass and i guarantee i don't use lipstick and my wife didn't have lipstick on either i told the barmaid and she just laughed it off . she should have compensated and either given me another drink or taken it off my bill .
please for the love of all that is awesome in the world owners read these posts and make changes . first of all i love pier 54 because it is a gorgeous scenery and chill spot to have a drink . you guys have a prime location but your losing local customers like me and at least 10 of my friends because the food is god awful and your bar is starting to look trashy . i've been in the restaurant business my entire life and alllll you need to do is seriously update your menu , use good fresh food , and spend a couple 1000 $ to spruce up the place . everything is torn and ragged and so sad to see it start to look so bad . i've returned my food there not once , not twice but 3 times and i don't ever return my food . my burger was burnt and dry , fries were so over seasoned i chocked , my spinach dip had a giant piece of plastic in it , and the salmon salad tasted like it was caught in the dirty lake . lastly the water just the water tastes like i'm drinking directly from the lake . please please please just make some changes i want to love this place so badly ! i'll come help you if i need to ! the owners deserve a steady stream of business but you gotta realize you need to make some changes !
forgive my ineptitude with south indian food , but i didn't really know what a dosa was . but if you asked me if i wanted a humongous , oversized , flavoured , savory crepe filled with your choice of spicy and intriguing filing , i'd say yes please ! . and that , my yelp friends , is what a dosa is . this comically large crepe dish seriously , look at my pic , it's the size of a small baseball bat was crisp yet soft , and had a bit of heat from chile oil . the filling was a mix of tofu and veggies which was well spiced . the side sauces were great , my favourite being some sort of tomato puree which i ran through quickly as i mopped up the filling and sauce with my crepe like awesomeness . i also had the watermelon juice which was fresh and tasty , but i'd ask for extra ice to get it nice and cold . super refreshing during the heat wave . all in all , a great meal for $ 10 ! vegetarian isn't normally my food of choice , but i'm a new fan of dosas , so i'll be back !
played here several times , always a great experience . great caddie staff , especially nicole . hate to see it turned into another hotel . hopefully we will get to play at least one more time prior to construction
this place was fine . like everything in vegas it was overpriced and i can make much better pasta at home . i got the spaghetti and meatballs , since it had a lot of positive reviews and i found the sauce to be kind of watery and bland . the meatball was huge and dense and also rather flavorless . i was starving however and the service was quick and friendly . frankly , i was disappointed with the food and wouldn't return , but the servers were really nice and made the experience more tolerable .
great food and excellent service . went to this location for brunch for the first time . the service was great and the food was amazing . i definitely liked the fact that this location wasn't as crowded as the huntersville location . i'll be back in the future !
i was there couple months ago . it took over an hour to get the food . they even told me they have to make the noodle from scratch . are you kidding me ?
we are a family of 5 2 adults and 3 young kids . the restaurant looks good and the food is decent with gluten free options but all this meant nothing with the very poor quality service at this restaurant . not sure if it was the owner but an oriental women with very short hair looks a bit male rushed us in without a smile or greeting and throughout it was quite difficult for us to get any of the waiter's attention to order things . at the end , the bill came with already included service charge of 15 which was quite surprising since we should be given the opportunity to tip according to our satisfaction of the service provided . the same male ish looking waiter commented that it was standard to charge this for 5 people . we were 2 adults with 2 kids and an infant . ! we refused to pay this and this waiter manager became emotional and threw our receipt at our table . left a very bitter taste and will never return to this place although we live down the street .
this place rainbow has got to be my favorite when it comes to thai ! i had the pad thai and we also ordered pork fried rice super yum ! the location off flamingo is also a thumbs up ! you gotta stop by or order to pick up . they are great and super friendly !
so i did not know what to expect when first finding this place as it said fames outside . but it was really cool inside with all the different arcade games i grew up with and a ton of new features . beer selection was great so come enjoy a cold one with friends and arcade games .
nicest customer service ! we came in at 9 56 when it closes at 10 , and john let us in with the biggest smile ! he took our order and not a single person working gave us attitude . we felt so bad but they couldn't have handled it any better ! we really appreciate it and always notice this every time we come here !
i've been here only three times and each time it was on a tuesday night for the half off sushi . beings that this was only the third time i've ever had sushi , i won't pretend to be a seasoned sushi expert . i know , i should get out more , but i really like the sushi here . and for ten bucks , it's a delicious treat . i only wish they had a better beer selection .
we had tickets to the masquerade party at the 9 in the vault it was our first visit to the 9 metropolitan and i have to say it was a delightful surprise , compared to any club on w6th . the club itself has a cool design with all the old vaults and seating areas . the hors d'oeuvres were great ! the kebabs a favourite . the desserts also amazing with bacon cream puffs and pumpkin cream cheese mini cakes , we were all pleasantly surprised . they were mixing top songs in a show tune manner that was fun and enjoyable . the staff were on point , everyone serving and working were all very courteous and accommodating to me and my friends . we had a great time and definitely will be visiting often , can't wait to come in this summer and check out the rooftop bar . a great experience
stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised . nice atmosphere inside , great service , good prices and the food was excellent . we're vegetarian and , although it was not on the menu , they made us vegetarian summer rolls , and a nice green curry dish with tofu . the server who i assume is the owner , was very pleasant and more than willing to discuss menu options with us and customize something . it's worth a visit for sure !
been coming here for the past 5 years . my absolute favourite hakka place . they make the best crispy beef and chilli chicken . friendly staff . small and classy ambiance .
this was probably one of the first poke places i've been to and i find myself comparing most new places i go to this one . while this place does not let you pick unlimited toppings , their topping choices is probably one of the best i've seen . i have still yet to find another poke place that offers tamago as a topping . the portions are quite decent and they don't skimp on the fish . they also don't overload on the rice . not a great place if you're looking to sit down . however service is very quick if you're looking for lunch to go . they also offer a loyalty card that provides every tenth order free . while i've discovered some other poke places around the continent that do other aspects better , i will never turn down an offer to go here .
i heart starbucks ! especially this location the employees here are the best . they work really hard and are always so nice . keep up the good work guys !
sweet and delicious . i'm not a big sweets eater but the ice cream at sweet republic is worth it . the waffle cones is the only way to go . perfectly crispy and not too thick . i had the butter pecan which was tasty . i also tried the mint chip which was less sweet and still very tasty .
ever since dr . krystal van lowe has left the office is a complete disaster . medical assistants have a rude attitude and are never friendly they could never assist you or answer questions in a timely manner . the doctor rushes because he has so many patients he's trying to see in a short amount of time . never faxed over my medicine that they were supposed to at the pharmacy . i will be leaving the practice and finding a better doctor . i would not recommend this office to anyone and i will never return . horrible service horrible staff horrible care and not up to par .
i called to have my air conditioning repaired and within 2 hours my technician , timur was at my home . from start to finish he was professional , courteous and gave me a great deal compared to the competitors ! nevada residential services is amazing ! thank you !
by far one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've been to in phoenix ! the most bang for your buck by far , at any rate . their pho is pho nomenal ha ! with every kind of authentic ingredient you can imagine ! it's a great place to get a great meal for about the price of a mcdonald's value meal , and the food is 100 times better and better for you ! the fried rice is great , i'm partial to the beef and pork . the barbequed pork and shrimp rice combos are pretty darn good too . try the addition of the vietnamese shrimp paste . there's a very decent vegetarian selection too , for all you non meat eaters out there . to drink , try the thai iced tea with tapioca boba . i'm a fan of thai iced tea and a fan of boba and it's one of the few restaurants in town that combines the two !
went to this mac in nordstrom last weekend to get my makeup done with some friends before going out . we booked early appointments before 6pm so there wasn't a wait . it was the first time i've ever had my makeup professionally done and i was a teensy bit nervous that i'd walk out with super dark eyebrows and makeup that didn't compliment me , but no need to worry , because my mua was fabulous ! she walked me through everything she was doing and asked for my input on all makeup choices . i came out looking and feeling amazing ! if you go , ask for tazia ! she is really sweet and super talented . thanks again , tazia !
i went for lunch on a thursday be prepared . this place is small , so it gives the perception of being very busy . but i'd be surprised if they do more than 60 70 covers for lunch . from the time of my order to the time i got my food was over 40 minutes hard to accept on a one hour lunch break , especially given their limited menu . i ordered the mushroom burger the mushrooms were rubbery and the burger had the taste of old grease like the grill wasn't properly cleaned and seasoned . the garlic fries were limp and really didn't have much of a taste other than maybe a little garlic salt powder . the cost was $ 11 . 99 . i expected a fresh and tasty burger with crispy garlic fries . i got neither . i can go to carl's jr and get the same quality burger and fries for 2 3 bucks less and much faster . very disappointing .
mixologist daniel was simply great . his old fashioned smoked using applewood chips was not only delicious but the process of making it was as good as any vegas show ! great prices on the food and beers here as well .
we have been ordering from here for years . very consistent , courteous and the best orange chicken ever .
i love samie ! she gives an incredible haircut . she's intuitive , efficient and friendly . samie is a great addition to the salon and i highly recommend her !
this place is really underrated ! saddens me to see almost no one here everytime . the food is amazing and the portions are generous . for two people , you can probably just share one entree and get an extra rice . this is def one of my favourite asian good places in markham . 10 10 would .
4 stars only because this was the first time here . it was a little loud , but the food was amazing i had the sea bass 5 stars there ! and the wait staff was friendly and attentive . we never had to ask for anything and always had full water glasses . i would certainly come back !
if you can't get to a farmers market , go to sanagan's . they have a good selection of interesting types of meat and cuts that you won't see other places . the guys that run the shop are really friendly and willing to chat about what you should do with your amazing piece of meat . great store , wholeheartedly recommend .
steak frites medium rare of course super delicious ! cooked to perfection . quiche lorraine melts in your mouth ! vanilla bean dessert amazing ! service was top notch . will go again ! total tab was $ 70 for two !
location strip mall west of the strip on spring mountain road parking ample outdoor parking but spaces are tight description vietnamese by name , but majority of menu items are chinese sprinkled with some thai dishes service expedient service , polite , most of the staff speak excellent english , staff is knowledgeable of the menu quality slightly above average egg rolls below average due to lack of flavor and small size pork chop was overcooked but the staff replaced the dish and it tasted great and the egg cake was perfect vegetable dish was overpriced but tasted good pho was perhaps too spicy and the beef was a bit overcooked environment 24 hour restaurant , extremely busy and moderately noisy restaurant , expect a short wait , clean value good the same dishes are 25 percent less expensive in los angeles diagnosis probable return visit
we ate here again today , 2nd time . better than the first , the only real chicago greek gyro in the valley . worth the 25 minute drive . george holds the bar high , no other place we have tried in the past year even comes close . i'm sure his other food is great , but we come for the gyro's , why try anything else when you have a winner ?
this is a nice place to eat during quiet times , when there is no popular sporting event taking place on tv . they have excellent sandwiches that are very large . roast beef , corned beef , and pastrami are all excellent . they also have the best fried zucchini i have eaten . the service is generally good , but not excellent . it is sometimes difficult to procure a drink refill . coupons are regularly available .
i have a teacup yorkie and i've struggled to find a groomer that i'm happy with in az . today i tried see spot shop and i am so impressed with her haircut ! the groomer was friendly and did exactly what i asked for . i'm also very impressed with the teeth cleaning and that it is done without anesthesia . the prices were fair , and the store was clean and cute . i'll definitely be back !
when i walked in i took a big whiff of the air . i became a little excited because it vaguely reminded me of new york . i sat patiently waiting . looking at how every single table in this place was packed and there were four parties waiting to be seated , i imagined i was in for a treat . but alas , i am in arizona , haven't lived in new york for 6 years and i simply need to learn to stop chasing the snake . new york pizza only exists in new york and i need to realize that good pizza doesn't need to taste like new york pizza . however i do argue that it should still taste good nonetheless . we had some wings , seemed frozen , typical stuff . i got a small salad , which was decent . the pizza , was average . the bolognese was simply marinara with meatballs , not bolognese . i really don't want to rate this place a 3 star location , i want to support the local restaurateur , but i have to cut the line somewhere . however i am not that familiar with arizona and maybe this truly is the best place around . if that is true , than i am sorry .
it's tough to go wrong with zoup as it fits every occasion from a warm break in the winter to a decent sit down lunch in the summer . strangely , the first time i came here i ended up coming back almost 2 weeks later if you've got the crab lobster bisque on your mind , i highly recommend giving it a try . with all the options too , it's a great place for people of all tastes .
the atmosphere of this place is quite nice it is smallish and fairly quiet it has a fireplace with comfy chairs it has nice comfortable booths for either studying reading or visiting with friends and it has good service . there is nothing overwhelmingly spectacular about the drinks or the treats food , but a nice atmosphere open until 1am , makes it 4 star worthy .
sure it's more expensive than other locations but thats a given considering its inside the mirage hotel and casino . service was pleasant . he checked on us just enough and we didnt feel rushed , bothered or like we had to wait . ordered the wedge salad to share along with the chicken tequila fettuccini . so good . it was the perfect amount of food for two . our server brought us extra plates making it easier to share as well . overall a nice experience for a late afternoon service on a busy saturday . bonus is the sports book right next to this open cpk so you wont miss a moment while you eat if you've got money riding on some games !
this is a vintage shoppers paradise ! the place is stocked full of original vintage finds from the 1920's and on . it may be packed full but it's easy to navigate between the different decades as they are clearly marked in select sections . the prices aren't outrageous if you're looking for something unique for a special dinner or event . you can tell that the owner goes above and beyond to find the best vintage selections . it's not just clothes too , but gorgeous jewelry and a very unique selections of vintage eyewear .
25 discount for father's day special . someone at my company got a fairytale brownies assorted gift pack and i got to try the morsels , sprites , and cookies there were 50 in the package ! . i suddenly became a cookie monster and devoured the cookie while typing in the website to order 32 cookies for my dad . what arrived was probably the best packaging for an online delivery i've ever seen i got protective styrofoam inside the shipping box with fairytale brownies' logo , ice packs methodically wrapped in paper to preserve the baked goods' freshness from arizona to boston , and an inner gift box with a large ribbon announcing happy father's day ! i contemplated putting it all back in to give to dad as is because it was so fun to unwrap . even the ice packs have the fairytale brownies' logo ! i tell ya they're a detailed bunch and it's these small touches that count . i'd also give kudos to the friendly customer service . i originally ordered the wrong item online and called to change my order . while i've been groomed to accept automated messages , long hold times , and scripted replies virtually everywhere else , my call here was answered on the first ring with conversational style politeness . all in all , the goods are delicious and are enchanted as they claim but not an everyday treat because it is quite sweet and higher end in price for me .
disney does so much dead on , perfect , right it's ridiculous . the stores are no exception . this store is so much better than arizona mills location . employees are very knowledgeable and extremely helpful . we love the viewing area with a jukebox type machine where my child can choose the store's music selection . little touches of magic are nice and could possibly distract you from the prices for the costumes . check the back left for clearance .
sorry mod , your management is poor , your lines don't move . i've stopped by twice in the last few weeks and both times , the line just doesn't move . and under your mod pizza sign it reads super fast . i call bull . slow slow slow . your pizza makers appear to have no clue what they are doing . reading the ingrediants from from the board . you are not ready for arcadia . clean up your act . get a manager who knows how to run a fast food restaurant . too many excellent pizza places to even bother stopping here .
we had the pad thai , the soup dumplings , the onion pancake , and a dim sum item . food quality is very high for the area . service is commendable . there was always someone close by to bring an extra drink , or hot sauce . the atmosphere at lunch time was busy , not too loud , and the food arrived at the table very quickly . we shared the pad thai vegetarian and were pleased that it was not bright red when it was presented . the onion pancake was a nice starter , but the soup dumplings were the star of the meal for myself . the menu is long and varied , so there will be something for everyone .
rundown , slow and lazy staff , poor ambience , dirty ambience , dingy ambience . how did red lobster come to this lower case intentional ? but the two dishes pictured are very good .
the staff are friendly and efficient . they were able to schedule me at a convenient time . the technology of exam equipment was the latest available . the staff taking me through the process were well trained . the doctor was very nice , explained the exam and took time for questions . the optician who helped me with my glasses after seeing the doctor was very knowledgeable and helpful . i have been a patient there for years and have not been disappointed .
while on a trip to pittsuburgh , we stopped into this store while walking around the strip district . now , i love to cook , so it was essentially like disney world in here . the store was laid out very well , and it is very easy to find anything you might be looking for . i think my favorite part was that they had a sample of just about everything in a jar that you could smell . i'd much rather buy a spice that i could essentially sample than take my chances on a grocery store stocked brand . needless to say , we walked out of there with quite a few goodies . the staff at the store was great to talk to and really knew their stuff . from talking to one of them , it sounds like they mostly hire cooks , which is really nice . if i lived in pittsburgh , i'd probably make this my one stop spice shop , but i don't . i need to find some place like this in cleveland . any suggestions ?
went in last week to get a simple dvd player installed to replace a broken one before a long car trip . the employee can't remember his name said to buy one online then come back and they could easily install it for $ 40 and would only take about 30 min . he was very nice and helpful . my husband came in to get the dvd player installed today . he talked to r and was told he didn't have time to install it anytime soon even though no one was there . r also told him it would be $ 80 . r acted like he didn't even want to try to help my husband schedule an appointment . my husband called the scottsdale location and they told him they could get him right in and install . it was only $ 49 . they were much more friendly and helpful . we wont be going back to this location !
i love this place ! i highly recommend this place to anyone ! hott nails has the best staff and service ! i get gel fills all the time and they always last super long , color never chips or anything . they always fit me in as a walk in and treat me with the best customer service ! bella and michael always give me the best looking nails and i get tons of compliments and i always recommend people here !
was hungry early so got fried pork potstickers . got 7 potstickers for 6 . 75 including tax . very good .
we stopped by here for dinner while in vegas and it turned out to be a good surprise . most of the fam bam got banh hoi which is ting noodles weaved together with a side of your meat and veggies . dip this in either the regular fish sauce or the stinky sauce stinky used in the most delicious stinky way possible and its heaven in your mouth . the service was okay but again , it's a viet place in vegas so you might as well mirror the little saigon experience . defiantly stop by if you want some authentic vietnamese food with good flavors .
i would say this place is actually more like a 3 1 2 stars . i was pleasantly surprised with this place . first off the atmosphere here is party all the way . the decor is so totally cool with the caribbean and nautical theme to the max . what a fun place to come . the service here is outstanding . our waiter was very friendly and talkative . as he is local he was full of great information to our questions about town and such . to our delight all 6 of us agreed that the food here was more and better than we expected . my shrimp and grits were excellent . one of the better versions i have had . others had burgers , fajitas and chicken fingers and everyone said good things while we enjoyed the food . the drinks here were also good . the portions and prices were right on and we left here full and content . i would definitely reccomend this place for a fun atmosphere and decent food with great service .
my family goes sledding here anytime we head up north for christmas . it's a massive park and i would like to visit it during the summer some time . while all i have done here is sledding , i know they also have snowmobiling , skiing , horse trails , tennis courts , hiking , and lots more i just don't know about .
wow were we just in trouble and wow did meyer's piano service just bail us out . thank you thank you thank you ! our teen age kids were playing the piano on their grandmother's prized mini grand piano . our son left his droid on the ledge and our daughter accidentally closed the cover over the keys and the cell phone fell under the keys . huge ouch ! and huge panic amongst us all . my husband found meyer's piano service in the phone book and placed a very panicked call . we were calmly instructed on how to unscrew two screws so we could then reach our hand under the keys and rescue the cell phone without damaging the piano . it worked ! we fully expected that we would have had to wait a week or so for someone to make a house call and that it would have been expensive . and my son would have been missing his cell phone in the meantime which was also a problem . we just called to express our appreciation , but i thought that writing a great yelp review would be the best way to say thank you . can't believe i am the first to write a yelp review for meyer's piano service . if you have a piano , don't even hesitate to call on meyer's first . thank you !
i've been looking for the closest thing to ny nj style chinese food in the valley and i think this is one of the two closest to it that i've had so far and thus the 5 star rating . it isn't chinese from ny nj but it's my favorite one tied with maxim restaurant 19th ave osborne . since i live in the west valley , i will be coming back to wong's more often ! started with a welcoming greet from the server and i ordered crab puffs half order , cup of dumpling soup , and the emperor's chicken . the crab puff were large , seemed like each piece had a tablespoon of cream cheese filling with which you can taste the slight crunch of shell , scallion , and minced onion and carrot . my fave crab puff in the valley lol . the dumpling soup was also really good . balanced flavor . now , when the emperor's chicken arrived , it came with plentiful of rice and was delicious ! my cup or water was always tended to and never reached empty . i recommend for others to try this place . i for sure will be coming back for their fast and friendly service , and delicious food !
the last shop i went to rounded off my oil drain plug , so after putting off my oil change as long as i could shame on me ! . i did some searching on yelp i found tempe auto repair which had some great reviews so i was sold ! walked in and the owner bill greeted us . took care of us and fixed the problem . tempe auto repair is friendly , honest , well priced . will definitely bring my car back and so should you !
best cold brew coffee i've ever had ! very expense for coffee , compared to starbucks but so much better
great location ! great ambiance ! fun place to get your drink on . mediocre food . when you charge $ 11 12 for a cheeseburger , it's best not to screw up the temperature . i ordered a cheeseburger medium which to me means a warm pink center , and it came out well done completely gray center , hot throughout . seeing the blue pick labeled medium sticking up out of my almost burnt burger made me laugh out loud . it was infuriating , but i was with a large group and did not want to be the a hole who complains when all are just trying to have a good time . total buzzkill . in addition , the meat was bland and tasteless , and the bun added more bland and tasteless to the already dull flavor . a $ 12 disappointment . this leads me to another gripe i have with joints using words in the menu to add price to their sub standard food . i am sick and freaking tired of reading free range or organic or grass fed next to a whopping price tag . if i pay twelve freaking dollars for a gosh darn cheeseburger , it better be one of the most awesome things i ever put in my mouth ! the patty on my bun was a $ 2 piece of meat maybe less , it was too well done to know for sure , but the bs phrases in the menu upped the price by $ 10 unacceptable .
excellent breakfast place . unlike other breakfast places , this place is not loud . the staff are very friendly and accommodating . i have been here for breakfast numerous times . the pricing is reasonable . it is hard to find decent breakfast places in scarborough .
i've had great care with the professionals at ahc . i'm always greeted with a smile and taken care of . dr . gilreath is kind and detailed with his care , he made me feel taken care of and listened to . kim b . , p . a . is very thorough . she noticed issues i didn't even schedule an appointment for . the office staff and m . a . s are friendly and organized . i've always been able to get in on the same day , even if the doctor stays a little late to meet my needs .
jackson fans will be satisfied , i know i was ! dancing ! singing ! costumes ! bought tickets at the box office at the rio . show included all of michael jackson's hits . great audience participation . i would have bought a ticket just to see thriller !
best breakfast ever ! smoothies are incredible , staff is incredible . even the lineup is fun , waited an hour , played my portable speaker outside , the whole lineup was dancing . once we got in the owner comped my breakfast , he loved the atmosphere we generated out there !
this restaurant is a must do while in pittsburgh . on a recent trip from phoenix i wanted to check out a place that showcased history of the burgh and this was at the top of my list . the food and quality of the items aren't the reason why you come here . you also don't come to be impressed by the serivice . the reason is to enjoy a long time staple of this wonderful city . where else have you ever heard of a sandwich with cole slaw and fries on it ? if so , i'm sure primanti's started the idea . walking in you feel like you are walking back in time to when the place was first opened . the decor is quite inviting for the worker or family type . not really for anyone fancy , but then again this place isn't anywhere near fancy ! located in the srip district , just a short jaunt from downtown i would tell anyone to pop their head into this place . to experience history as well as enjoying all of the stores markets in this area .
this is another example of when i wish there was a half star option . location is what gives this place 4 stars otherwise 3 . 5 . good food , friendly staff , relaxing diner atmosphere , all make this place an enjoyable spot to stop and grab breakfast or . lunch . i usually order the bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings . it is exactly what you would expect from a diner . i will continue to be a customer here and support my local business .
the sushi is amazing and the staff is very friendly . the fish tastes fresh and so do the ingredients . definitely my favorite sushi spot !
this is my sushi spot . always fresh , always clean always friendly . and they have the best 'all you can eat' price . $ 14 . 99 lunch 19 . 99 for dinner . that is an unbelievably amazing price . i've eaten here at least twice a month for the past 2 years and i've never received any bad service , nor bad sushi
love this location , food is always good . they don't skimp on the taco fillings . love the staff here , always friendly even if their english is not very good .
waited about 20 minutes and that wasn't even a aknowledge by nobody . no one said anything they would not answer my question i just wasted the time there so i just walked away i never seen such a horrible customer service .
visited here on a thursday night . there were only three other tables occupied . two servers and yet service was slow . took at least thirty minutes to get a reuben and irish nachos . the sandwich was good and the fires marginal served with a mystery flavored ketchup . nachos were cold potato chips with hot globs of what i assume were melted cheese curds on top and minuscule amounts of corned beef $ 3 extra served with a side of sour cream . i asked for the salsa that was mentioned in the menu and was told they told they do not have salsa . the guinness was good but couldn't have a second harp because they couldn't change the keg . overall , not a great time .
delicious . my wife and i hit up vietnamese in most of the cities we travel to , and this one was top notch . great decor , prompt service and great value . our entire meal including tip was less expensive than the shitty theatre snacks we had earlier in the day . a welcome addition to the riverbend neighborhood .
tom was incredible . he did everything possible to help with opening the impossible locking mechanism with my business . i turned out that it needed the actual door installer and a power saw to get it open , he stayed through the whole process to ensure i got in and that he was able to see the inner workings of this impossible mechanism . such a great professional . i would call him again in a heartbeat .
i've been seen by both dr katherine and dr dave since about mid december for . injuries resulting from my car accident . they are both equally amazing , caring and attentive professionals who really care about making you better . they do so by taking the time to listen not just your aches and pains but of your concerns too ! they explain the treatments and the reasoning behind it . the use of the activator is so much better than the traditional bear hug spinal manipulations . no fear of neck cracking . or an oops . their office is always clean and inviting . their office staff is equally amazing , friendly , kind and curtious while still maintaining the professionalism one would expect . can't say enough about them ! love the text message appointment reminders and easy checking . i would recommend them in an instant and have done so !
don't order their burgers . i'm still hungry . for $ 13 you can probably get more food elsewhere . frozen burger , 1 piece of cheese and some bbq sauce . the actual burger was as round as a coffee mug . you could probably place the burger on a slider bun and get away with it being a slider .
it's hard to know where to start with jessica gelder and shine events . i was given jess' name by my wedding venue as a preferred planner and upon talking to her for the first time it was clear that she was beyond the best choice . not only am i incredibly grateful for being introduced to jess , but i feel incredibly grateful that she agreed to take on our wedding . as all brides know wedding planning has its ups and down , the stress can be high and the number of moving parts can be overwhelming . from the moment i started working with jess , there was never a moment when i ever thought she didn't have all of this under control and or that she wouldn't be there to support me and my family in any way she could . she has a way about her that calms you , makes you feel understood and also that you've got someone in your corner to make everything happen . she makes time for her brides , works so hard and knows all the best wedding secrets ! her style , vision , and insight when it comes to weddings and life in general are impeccable and truly i credit her and her hard work for making my wedding the perfect day for myself , my husband and our families lives . without her , our day wouldn't have been half of what it was . she created the most beautiful event i've ever seen and ensured it went off without a hitch . since my wedding day , i've been telling everyone how incredible she is and how much i'll miss working with her every day . i don't anticipate this will stop anytime soon . as my husband would say . i'm objessed and i hope you get to be someday too .
we were excited to try something new we can't stand biscuits a block away . it's clean neat inside , very generic and boring . the staff is really sweet friendly but i think if they get busy a lot of confusion could ensue . they kind of seem to step all over each other . espresso is a bit bitter shots are pulled too long coffee is a very light roast not much flavor . breakfast . meh . it's edible but nothing exciting . what's interesting is they promote website their fresh baked croissants etc yet none were offered or on display at 9 am . would love to see them grow be successful . on the fence at this time tho . we are rooting for you ! give them a shot . let's help them do this .
this was our first experience at this restaurant and going to be the last . the worst food we have ever eaten . the sampler platter , pizza and gluten free pizza was terrible . the portions for the sampler platter was small and over priced . the pizza and gluten free pizza were very expensive . i would never recommend this place to anyone . the managers were trying to help but were reaching across our plates to clear the table . the food is overpriced and terrible .
i love bradbury's . i live a block away and head here just about every weekend . their crepes are really tasty and their coffee is great , too . i also appreciate that they have fast wifi and even though it can get a little tight it's a small place , i've never not been able to find a seat . plus , the big windows make it the perfect place to absorb a sunny morning and do some people watching .
i came here with a few friends from work to do our fantasy football league . this side of town is still brand new so the bar is spotless . we sat in the back near the big screen tvs and had the whole area to ourselves . from 4 7pm , with a pt's card , all alcohol and pizzas are half off . we got 2 bbq chicken , one italian style , and one popcorn chicken pizza to nosh on while picking . many drinks later , a bucket of wings , and a few more items and our bill came out to a very reasonable price . when it comes to hanging out with the guys , the damage can be massive . luckily , hh helps alleviate some of the burden .
if you are looking for the best facial of your life , look no further . i have never been a huge fan of facials as they always seemed to do more harm than good , but my problem was just bad aestheticians . alana is the real deal and does a phenomenal job . my skin looks and feels so much better . i can not believe that it took me so long to find someone so great . i have tried a number of her treatments and each one is just as wonderful as the last . i have had her do my eyebrows as well and really like how she shapes them . while i have never had my makeup done by her , if i ever needed it done she would be the first person i would go to . she has a passion for her work and is very knowledgeable if you have questions about your facial products or the best way to treat your skin . if you are still hesitant , just make an appointment . i guarantee you and your skin will be happy you did .
mother and daughter outing . we had a blast ! great location , easy to find , not crowded , good light . our instructor was katie . she was a ball of fun ! detailed , easy to follow instructions . fun music to sing along with . love that she wore a microphone . the beverages both adult and child friendly were tasty and affordable . loved that they provided cookies . we and as many people as we can drag along will definitely be back ! thanks ladies !
went here with a friend on an apparent slow day . the place was pretty empty and felt a bit too urban for the venetian . i imagine this place downtown in hipster ville or town square , but it felt so odd at this casino . in other news the prices are steep for what you get . we ordered the sliders which i believe were $ 12 dollars . we received 3 white castle tasting burgers . they were good and came out fast , but i'll be damned if i couldn't go to the local grocer and get a family size box of 12 for $ 6 . 99 . usually sliders are ground , formed and grilled in house . these tasted like white castle . no sides to speak of with that price tag . the drink was $ 13 and with tip we spent $ 29 for 3 sliders and a drink . i'll hit up with slidin' thru next time .
i'm actually surprised at how highly rated this restaurant is . it's definitely not an authentic thai restaurant and their food is average . service was top notch though ! i stopped by on the way home to get pad thai for takeout . their pad thai was ok . but could use more spices . it really wasn't anything special . my friend ordered the pineapple fried rice and said it was average also . i've heard good things about their curry , which i will definitely be trying out the next time i'm here . perhaps for a dine in . bigggg plus on their service . the managers greeted me right away as i stepped in the door . they're very friendly people and even brought me water while i was waiting for my food takeout .
customer service is dead . i had a very simple request let me leave breast milk for my son in a freezer for 6 hours between the time i needed to check out and the time i leave for the airport . after calling 4 different departments no one would offer to do that for me each person i spoke to said , try calling this department . , they absolutely refused to let me leave a small bag of breast milk in a freezer anywhere in the building . i'm sure if i requested something ridiculous like 'hey , i brought my dog , will someone walk him and pick up his poop for me every 3 hours ? they would have no problem . but helping out a nursing mother who has to be away from her baby for a work trip ? nope , you're sol .
i was playing poker at encore and i saw the guy next to me order what looked like a pad see ew that really smelt good , so i decided to order a dish from the wazuzu menu . i ordered the pineapple fried rice with duck . i had a few drinks at this point but i can clearly remember the dish tasting amateur . tasted more like cajun fried rice than the typical chinese fried rice . it was overpriced , and i typically mind over paying for something that taste good , but i honestly could have bought better fried rice in china town for a third of the price .
i hung out with some friends at cogburn's this last weekend . the bar is great . our service was amazing and i believe the prices were very fair . fun place to hang out !
i like the most spicy garlic trio red hot garlic . order it ever time i have been there .
best kim bap in town hands down . cute waitresses too i tried some of their soups . i liked the tofu soup everything else wasn't memorable . but , i guess cute waitresses go a long way . oh , sometimes theirs a cute dog hanging out in there . i don't mind but , if you have dog allergies .
had an appointment for an acrylic refill with gel polish , they took me just in time for my appointment , and it took just over an hour . linny did a great job with the shaping i wanted square coffin , she was quite quick but efficient ! no lumps , no unevenness on my nails and they came out natural looking even though they were long ! will definitely be returning to get my next fill . this salon has a ton of colour brand options and it was only $ 30 for top notch quality !
best in the las vegas area hands down . great prices , great portions . i wish they were open longer hours . great food variety and friendly people and always a clean environment .
took my aussie friend here for dinner last night , with lowish expectations . pros the kangaroo steak and barramundi were both prepared well nice wine selection and our server gave us a great recommendation on a bottle surprisingly good music playing radiohead , etc . cons really , really uncomfortable seating . the cheese plate is uninspired the offerings are pretty pedestrian not even a goat cheese , and the prosciutto was cut in thick slabs . eww . also , the nuts on the plate were just silly the paper thin almond slices were hard to even pick up and the small , cinnamon covered nuts didn't complement the cheese or the meat . i've seen better cheese plates at fry's deli department . i had to point out that our check had been calculated incorrectly overcharged . now that we've satisfied our curiosity about this restaurant , i can't see driving all the way out to gilbert again to dine here . if it was just up the street , i could see stopping in to have a glass or two of wine , but then we'd go someplace else after for better food and more comfortable seating .
with so many burgers available in las vegas from celebrity chefs , i still think i prefer shake shack's . i was a first timer who ordered one of everything . first bite of the shake stack made the taxi ride from the other side of the strip and the line to the cashier worth it . it's the cheeseburger with a fried mushroom stuffed with muenster and cheddar cheese and shack sauce . it's rich and so good in between the soft potato buns . there's never too much cheese so we indulged in cheese fries and i was blown away ! crispy edges and soft and gooey under the almost velveeta like cheese sauce . do i dare say i like this better than in n out's animal fries ? the simplicity did it for me . i'm not sure where i found room for it but i dug deep and killed a shack cago dog . if you like pickled veg this is for you . yum though the burgers were the winners . for the holiday season they were offering fun frozen custard options like gingerbread and peppermint chocolate . i went for the classic and had a vanilla frozen custard shake . thick custard , great flavor but in n out wins the shake comparison for me . overall , i'm a fan and can't wait to come back ! crossing my fingers they open another west coast location in san francisco .
dr . z and the staff have been extremely supportive , and i was able to adjust the program to something that works for me . i am a lifetime member of weight watchers , but every time i need help eg . after injuries the program and all the points have changed again . also , i was not eating enough protein on weight watchers , as those were high point foods . this plan is easy and fast , and i hope to never have to count points again !
the people that work here are extremely nice and replaced my best friends phone screen quite quickly around 30mins , which was awesome . around an hour later we noticed that the screen had cracked again . the phone wasn't dropped , this is unacceptable . came back today to have it fixed again and they told us that they would have to charge another $ 200 to fix it and there wasn't any warranty to their screens etc . this is absurd . i highly recommend anyone to go literally anywhere else because this place for a fact does cheap quality phone repairs . definitely should have read the reviews before coming here . now i'm just another disappointed customer and will make sure my facebook are aware of this low quality as well .
nice start but considering there 24 hours at 1 am i went to fill me rx and the wait was still a half an hour , the entire reason i came at this time was to get my medicine norco from my dentist for my pain sooner rather than later but i guess i'm not the only one who goes at 1 am to fill scripts
we went here to have brunch with a friend that was driving back to nashville , tn following our meal . we had reservations for 8 and while the food was decent , the customer service was horrendous . our checks were brought to us before our whole group finished our meals . beyond that , the hostess came over and stood right by our table . paused long enough for us to look up . and said rather loud and rudely , i need this table set up for 12 . we had been there an hour at this point . while i realize brunch is a busy time , i found this behavior unacceptable and will not be dining at this restaurant for this very reason .
roma 1090 is seriously good food . we had a seasonal pizza that was delicious and paired it with chicken parmigiano . the sauces of the chicken in marinara and the fettuccini alfredo were simply devine mixed together . we added capers to give the mix a little tanginess . my mouth is signing the praises of roma 1090 . bellisimo !
this place is amazing . they carry every brand of high quality dog food imaginable , and the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable . my puppy had parvo as a baby and has had stomach problem ever since . the vet has tried a million things and finally settled on putting him on horrible hill's prescription i d food that cost $ 300 a month for his size . heidi at pet club got him on limited ingredient diet and now he is perfectly fine ! it is really a miracle . she even told me we were even able to bring the bag of food back and try new ones until we found one that worked without paying a dime , but we didn't need to because she nailed it the first time . thank you pet club !
i went here only because waffle cafe was closed . we got there 45 mins before close and they told us they shut down the dining area 15 minutes before closing time . they honestly looked shocked we even came in at that time . as a family of four , we spent about $ 60 four waffles , four drinks and the thinnest pieces of bacon i've ever seen . needless to say we left hungry . they brought out one waffle at a time and my husband almost didn't get his food in time for us to eat there . we rushed to eat and get out in time not to get kicked out . they weren't flat out rude but i wouldn't call them friendly either . well that is until we were leaving and then it was like bye have a great night ! honestly i would never go back . i get way better service , way better food and for less at waffle cafe . i've never left there hungry and i have even heard them training their staff and the owner repeatedly mentioned customer service . plus it's much more comfortable and cleaner in waffle cafe . i wouldn't waste my time going here unless you aren't that hungry and you have money to blow .
omg ! so yummy ! make sure you get there early ! the donuts are huge ! i got the grill cheese one the last time i went and it was so amazing . along with the staff always upbeat and happy . and so many vegan options as well .
horrible service . stuck here in charlotte because weather caused me to miss my connecting flight . my hotel recommended this place for delivery and i wish they didn't . i placed an order at 9 40pm . they wait until 11 30pm to call and tell me that their drivers car broke down and they will be unable to deliver our dinner . what kind of chain pizza delivery place has only one driver ? now i'm stuck in my room with no dinner and everyone else is closed . stay away from this place , worst customer service i've ever experienced .
very professional staff , clean environment . it isn't very far from the strip , but i wouldn't recommend walking ! very fair pricing and friendly people . i would highly recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo during their vegas vacation . it's much more affordable then tattoo shops found on the strip and it looks a lot nicer too !
this cafe is amazing ! a must if you enjoy french coffee , pastries crepes . the two chefs are kind obviously love what they do . their croissants are on par with du pain et des idees in paris .
i stopped in on a mission . i wanted a more breathable helmet for summer riding and i choose trek because i had a gift certificate . being used to small shops where my friends are mechanics , i had my doubts that this shopping trip would be as enjoyable . someone greeted me right away and was super helpful and genuine . he helped me find the right fit and talked through all my questions . i was out the door with an affordable helmet i love in under 10 min . you totally surprised me trek , good work !
i just had a planned surgery here . i had not been in a hospital as a patient in 29 years but i have been on the other side as caregiver to my mom way too many times . cmc was wonderful . the staff was top notch . everyone was kind and knowledgeable . the facility was clean . i think everyone there enjoyed their job . there were no alarms going off constantly . when i called for a nurse the front desk always answered immediately and my nurse showed up in nothing flat . my advice avoid caromont in gastonia at all cost ! even the food was good and there is a chick fil a and a panera bread inside the hospital .
this is just like most bd's thay are scattered around the country . they have your standard selection of meats and veggies . they have a good selection of sauces and seasonings . the chefs are very good at preparing the food which came to me everything very fresh and extremely tasty . if you have never come here before the waiter will explain to you how the do it yourself meal works . its certainly very gin either to go by yourself or with a group of friends .
i should never expect much for chinese food in vegas . we tried one roll and it was pretty decent . however , it was very small . stay clear of the peanut noodle . overly salty and didn't offer much . plus the noodles were like spaghetti noodles . the curry fried rice was decent . potsticker could have been worse . they have happy hour for $ 5 martinis but they didn't have any alcohol taste in them . stay clear of the sushi shots . that was advice from our server . o yeah , service was pretty wack since there wasn't anyone in the restaurant .
pho ga and shrimp spring rolls were both tasty , and the service was friendly . our new favorite pho place ! we will be back .
vanity nail bar is clean , and probably the most trendy mesa , az has going . they were very nice , however my gel pedicure was not a good experience . i just moved from vegas , and was looking to find a place i could go regularly , but i won't be going back to vanity . my pedicure took 2 hours and not because it was a relaxing 2 hours . it's because i'm pretty sure my name tech had never done a pedicure . i've had $ 20 dollar pedicures better than this , and i paid $ 75 . the massage and foot scrub was maybe a total of 1 min for both feet . the gel polish job was pretty terrible also because she didn't even clean up around the edges with nail polish remover so there is nail polish on my skin that was dried on with the uv light !
what a great place ! those of you in the area are lucky to live close ! every time i'm in town i go see nikki for a hair cut . she knows exactly what will work with my hair , i trust her judgement completely !
carl is amazing . he has a good crew of guys he works with . they provide honest service and are very affordable . i have been using carl's cool cars for about two years now and have taken 4 different cars to carl . i've never been disapointed and felt great and confident about their service and prices .
maybe my expectations were too high walking in but it was just ok to me . first thing you should know is you don't have a set , single server here . all the employees kinda take care of all the tables . we had a waitress take our order and then no one came by for about 30 minutes until the food came out . in that time we had no refills on drinks and just sat there wondering where the waitress had went . well she never came by again lol . we had others stop by to see if we needed anything after that but i just didn't expect that . my sister and i had ordered the creamsicle mimosa . it sounded amazing on the menu but we both were sadly disappointed . it tasted just like a creamy regular mimosa , mostly just cream and champagne . it needed more orange flavor . i squeezed an orange slice into it that came with the breakfast and then it tasted a little better . for my brunch entree i ordered the corned beef and hash . it came with two eggs and hollandaise sauce on top . eggs were cooked perfectly how i wanted them . it had good flavor but the corned beef hash was more like corned beef bits like bacon bits instead of pieces . it was chopped so tiny that it was mostly the potato hash with a hint of corned beef . if it had bigger pieces it would have been delicious ! my husband had an omelet which he liked but it was pretty standard . now on the other hand my sister had ordered an avocado omelet and it literally had one little piece of avocado . they should have called it a tomato omelet , very stingy on avocado here . the bill for my husband and myself was $ 33 plus tip so we spent $ 40 on breakfast and it was just ok . not bad food by any means , it was good , but i've had better for cheaper .
wish there was a half star or an unhappy face . it's budget . but so is airtran and southwest and they're money compared to this company . customer service rep was polite but i waited an hour to talk to them . website is also poor and unhelpful i found for my purpose of changing a flight . this was my second business interaction . people are decent but policies are horrible . don't recommend the effort , it's hardly with the price .
i love mexican food . like , a legit , loyal and unwavering love . i have reviewed my favorite place three amigos , which is awesome . so awesome that you should stop reading this and just go to three amigos and eat an empanada . zapatas is not delicious . at all . we went for a friend's birthday party . they were closing at 11 and we were the last to get there so they told our friend we had to order at 10 30 if we wanted to eat . so , without seeing a menu , we just ordered a standard chimichanga via our friend over the phone . when we got there , our food was on the table . here is how i knew it was going to be not so good the refried beans had melted cheddar cheese on it . not the normal , name i don't know white cheese but shredded cheddar you get from harris teeter . it was not tasty at all . the rice was bland . the chimichanga was dry . i honestly have nothing good to say other than i hope you read my post and avoid this place .
valentines 2 14 11 bopped in here for a quick margarita tonight before we left the strip . i have only had a full meal here once but the burrito i had was $ 15 and worth every penny . the burrito was double the size of a chipotle style and even more tasty . margaritas are decent price for being apart of the mandalay bay chain as well as the authentic tacos . mostly a noisy bar atmosphere but well decorated with a great friendly staff . good place to catch a quick drink of a meal before heading out on the strip .
great concept for space in this location . there is plenty of seating , so i imagine you could find a bench or chair even when it's busy here . however , on a saturday morning at 6 am , it's an oasis of calm .
hailey is the best bartender ever , she's so cute and attenative . thanks for making our visit memorable .
love this place . bo and staff are awesome . new menu is out and more choices available , less expensive . not just for hangovers ! i don't have that problem although , i highly recommend the regular priced vitamin drip . i thought i was getting an ear infection , so i visited and i truly believe that this treatment helped me tremendously . a plus was how great my skin looked the next day ! it was glowing .
thank you brannon and team at citywide home loans ! my husband and i just recently bought our 2nd home in scottsdale and thanks to brannon and his team , the process was easy and fast ! we even closed early . thank you for taking the time with us to review all of our options and ensure that everything went smoothly .
dr sanchez is the best chiropractor i've ever been to , he goes above and beyond . very gentle and caring . i've been going here for years and the price is great , you don't feel like you can't go back for follow ups .
solid diner . good breakfast . very kid friendly . nice and attentive staff .
sat down for a pre dinner drink , the guy behind the bar said we had to play $ 20 to get a drink comped . sure why not , we all put money in the machine at the bar . throughout the our time there he kept checking on our machines 'making sure' we were gambling , we were $ 60 deep . every time he checked he would have to make a comment about playing faster , which was weird . mid game playing he walked over and said how we can't put $ 20 in then cash out at $ 10 . uuhhh we never planned to . i said , can't we play however we want ? his response was a firm no . cool . so we cashed out and left . not a good vibe , lights are too bright , old bartender guy sucks .
we are having a great night at pomo ! service is great so is the food ! the patio is the perfect place to eat in fall in arizona !
in my recent shopping adventures i've realized there's a lot of hidden vintage stores that aren't advertised as vintage . they may have some new and they may have some old , but one things for sure , they have a lot of really unique and fun merchandise ! the one thing that really stood out was the fun tea and tea sets . i'm always a sucker for anything tea related , to get in check with me english side of course ! one of the really cool things they offer is individual republic brand tea bags sold in cute packaging . this is ideal if you're looking to try out a new flavor of tea and aren't sure if you'll like it . it's also a really cute gift to give to someone with , say , a cute tea cup . they also have a lot of gift offerings such as cards , fun magnets and eccentric purses and key chains . but the really fun part is they also have vintage jewelry mixed in . i'm a sucker for any selection of vintage jewelry , so this a nice treat ! if you're on the hunt for eclectic gift items or vintage accessories for perhaps . yourself yep , i said it ! visit this cute little shop !
absolutely terrible . closet bar to where i live , but i'd rather pay for a taxi to any other bar in oakville . poor beer selection , no character to the decor , and they don't take debit . get it together , 6th line .
visting my family for thanksgiving . i was the only one who wanted turkey so i picked up a take out dinner . it was great , good portion , food was good quality and tasted delicious . the vegetables were yummy and a good variety . only negative was the stuffing was soggy instead of moist and fluffy , this may have happened bc the gravy got mixed in . i would suggest requesting the gravy in a separate container . the chocolate chip cookies were so delicious as well as the cherry pie . i will be back to visit for breakfast . i am surprised at the other reviews for this place and other local restaurants . i lived in charlotte before moving to ca and have been to many of the local restaurants . maybe its just me but charlotte folk seem to be very critical of their local eateries . i am referring to a review left a few days ago about the condition of the restaurant . there is a huge sign when you walk in stating that they are refurbishing the tables , booths , etc . as for the review about the under cooked omelet , if you weren't happy you should have requested a new omelet and potatoes . i would love to have these restaurants close to my home with fresh local produce . please try to support your local restaurants and give your feedback to the restaurant so they can work to improve what you dislike . at the end of the day they are here to serve you and make sure you are happy
pita pit is a nice little place on kennedy and progress . you can find it right beside the gas station near kennedy commons . pita pit is not a fancy establishment with great decor or anything , but the quality of the ingredients and preparation are top of the line . personally when i eat fast food , i like the preparation process , for example , subway , harvey's etc . in short , pita pit is a great , affordable place to grab a nice healthy lunch or dinner . you get the customization options to make your wrap taste the way you want it . all in all i give this place a good recommendation . you can sit in and eat late at night , or you can take your pita to go , either way , you'll love this place .
i have been a client of esther's for years and i cannot tell you how amazing i feel after every time i get my hair done . thank you esther for always taking the time to make me feel beautiful you are truly the best hair person ever !
first time here and definitely recommend ! the environment was probably my favorite thing aside the delicious food . the fiesta nachos are a must try and the micheladas were soooooooooooooo good !
we tried millers for the first time and were pleasantly impressed . the food prices were similar to places like chilis but had a funner variety of foods .
this is not my first choice of places to stay , but it was ok , went in the winter season so the pool wasn't open , parking was ok and it is very close to the mall , has some cool shops inside too . the le crepe was my favorite . close to the strip on the stripe so it's right in the middle of vegas .
i love all the baked goods and i love the cafe area to sit in . the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is that the bubble tea was not my favorite in the area . it was more like a flavored milk than a milk tea .
beautiful restaurant with outside seating and complimentary valet . however the food was not up to par . we started with the bread it came with a dip that was tasteless n the waitress did not tell us what it was . the bruschetta was way to sweet . for dinner the risotto with scallops . the scallops were extremely salty . even the tiramisu was not the norm , it had a gelatin like layer , layered throughout the cake .
entered my room after a day of work to find the room had been entered despite do not disturb request due to not using towels or needing linens changed as well as plastic bag over fire alarm . clearly the staff is not thorough or trustworthy . in addition management is absent and unapologetic . hilton does not value business , whether large corporate account or individual . buyer beware .
yasu specializes in omakase sushi set course . there's normally 18 pieces of sushi , as well as dessert and tea for $ 80 . they also have a $ 120 premium course with sashimi and other extra fare . reservation normally has to be done weeks in advance . they ask for credit card info and full meal price will be charge if cancelled last minute . so it's important to commit ! p we had seats at the sushi bar and was able to watch the chef preparing our meal . when each piece was served , the chef would tell us what it is , and where it is from . for some more uncommon fish types , the waitress came by and showed us photos of the fish in between courses . all the ingredients were super fresh and delicious ! they my favorite was the toros tuna . there were three pieces from lean to fatty , and you can really taste the difference between the fat content . the eel and uni were also very delicious ! i added an additional hokkaido uni at the end , and it just had the subtle sweetness and was so good ! yasu is definitely worth the splurge !
great bulgarian food . fantastic whole fish . ambiance just ok . service good . has some greek dishes . i ate there about 4 times and the food was great every time .
let's get the first thing straight . i love fish . but i hate cooking it indoors for obvious reasons . now let's talk about how awesome the fish store is . great sandwiches or plates made with any kind of fish you can think of . the two i've tried is grouper and tuna . they make the sandwhich with nice fresh bread , lightly fried fish , a pesto sauce and lemon . i usually add acacia do to that make sure you ask for it in the sandwhich otherwise they give it to you on the side for some reason . i love the hole in the wall look and mom pops feel of this place too . must try for fish lovers in toronto .
i have been here twice in the last four months and each time i have been very pleased and grateful for the treatment we received . the first time was to have our boy with lymphoma put to sleep and they were very caring and compassionate . during this awful time they were all attentive and sensitive and our boy slipped away in a very peaceful way . the second time was for an illness our other dog had and they were very thorough with his care and diagnosis . the staff is always very nice and checking up on you as you wait asking if you need anything . dr meredith is a dr i would see on a regular basis if she were at a normal vet practice .
just bought a beautiful used car from scottsdale porsche . the service was amazing . from the moment i walked in kevin was attentive and listened to everything i was looking for . will most definitely be back for my next one !
had a good breakfast buffet . a little pricey but this is a hotel restaurant . had plenty of choices , from toast , to chipotle bisquits and gravy . with orange juice refills , it was worth it .
yummy turkey veggie sandwich on fresh baked cheese bread . the menu is small , but what they offer is extremely fresh and satisfying . there is a large assortment of baked goods , and the cinnamon roll i sampled was delicious . the owner , cora , is extremely friendly , as are the counter staff . if you want a quick snack or seek an alternative to the sub sandwich chains , give badger bakery a try .
tony's has a huge selection of decent quality fabric at ridiculously low prices . their recent setup has been in one room all fabric is $ 6 . 99 per yard and in another room all fabric is $ 12 . 99 per yard . this past weekend everything was 50 off so i got 4 yards of fabric for about $ 15 . 00 . you absolutely can't beat that ! although i had limited interactions with the people that worked there , they seemed pretty friendly and helpful . two notes 1 . tony's has a lot of rules posted all over the store . only 5 samples per customers , don't cut your own samples , don't remove the bolts from the rack , control your kids , etc . 2 . the fabrics are kind of smelly so make sure that the fabric you buy is machine washable or isn't stinky i know that sounds weird , but i think some of the fabric has been in there for a while and smells musky or something ? bottom line , if you need fabric , come to tony's first . they have a better selection and much better prices than anyone in the charlotte area !
first time here . found this restaurant on yelp . called to see if they were open on new year's day . vet pleasant lady answered the phone . the restaurant is very nice . the pho was fantastic . the service and price for 2 meals are fantastic .
let see . come early . bring a book , your ipad . a game device . something because you are in for a wait . truly though . it's well worth it . all reviews are raving about the red velvet pancakes and every positive review is the truth ! it's so moist and yummy it's unexplainable . so my little family of 4 2 adults , 2 tweens . each ordered something different so we could all share . mom loco moco which was tasty . nothing special . all beef patty with yummy gravy over rice , topped with an egg over easy . dad adobo fried rice super filling and yummy . this omelet of chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an egg is huge . share . daughter s'more pancakes . and a side of egg son spam scramble . it is what it is . and it is goooood . d and of course . the red velvet pancake ! yuuuuum me ! totally be prepared for the wait . it's a wait . they tell everyone 20 minutes and it can carry over 30 . the place is small and with a million people waiting to get in , it's obvious why there's a wait . i can't wait till this thing spreads like wildfire and chains open . or they make it bigger . we definitely need one of these babies in the southwest area ! hint hint !
i had a great time at the show . not to surprising some of their tricks will blow you away . definitely recommend the show and if you have the patience you can get your picture with penn and teller after the show . tickets are a little pricey but they're less then some of the other shows on the strip .
i can't say enough good stuff about this store . went in late 8 40pm and needed a new phone because my old one broke . signed in but so many people waiting i didn't get seen until 9 10 pm ! 10 minutes after closing . javier said oh , don't worry , we will get you fixed up . i have nowhere to be ! and he spent almost 45 minutes resetting my phone , getting me my new phone , and because the buy one iphone get one free promotion was on and we decided to also hook up a second line . which made our appointment a little more lengthy . nothing was too much trouble , literally nothing . i have never had this kind of service in a cell phone store before . usually these folks are over worked and harassed and it shows but javier was polite , respectful , funny and super easy to work with . i give this store , well javier 12 10 . guess where i will go next time i need to spend another $ 1000 on phones ? ! ? ! . thanks javier for making a really crappy day much better .
very popular and does not take reservations . tried for lunch yesterday 90 minute wait , dinner ditto before finally getting in today for breakfast . food was good and different . i had walleye and eggs ! vegetarian options available . service was really slow despite the restaurant not being that busy .
the food was so good . i spent 79 $ for seven dishes . even the peach sunset tea was refreshing and delicious , i normally can't drink things without sugar but the quality of this tea was top of the line .
ran by for a quick breakfast burrito since i was stopping for gas . i assumed it would be flavors similar to roberto's . i got the bacon breakfast burrito . flavor was so so , nothing to rave about . what turned me off was the fact that they loaded it bacon ends . so , loaded with bacon is usually good , except for the fact that most of them were pure fat . nothing like biting into big chunks of fat instead of crispy bacon . like a ridiculous amount of fat chunks . $ 6 . 95 for a fat chunk burrito . perhaps the other ones are better . perhaps i'll try later on . more than likely not .
we came here with a largeish group to celebrate a few birthdays . my in laws have raved about corrado's forever so it was time for me to try it out . we came in at about 6 on a weekend we had a reservation and while it was quiet when we arrived , it very quickly filled up to capacity . on a recommendation , i got one of their pizzas as most of the family raved about them being delicious . unfortunately , the wait was substantial for our food , whether that was because we were a large party of 9 or because they were busy , i'm not sure . it was a bit disappointing to watch all kinds of delicious food coming out of the kitchen going elsewhere though ! it also took a while for my mother in law's pasta dish to come out all the rest of us had been served and she was the last person without a dish for a few minutes . i do have to say that everything was salty as another reviewer mentioned . it took away from the dishes as a whole unfortunately . i'm sure we'll be back but i think this place is way overrated for what it is . the food was good but it wasn't as good as everyone is saying .
used to go here all the time . new management changed the format , the great bartenders left , lost all the regulars and now it looks like a mortuary every time i drive by . sad really . i used to love this place ,
this sushi place was designed for me . really affordable sushi all the time why do rolls have to triple in price because it's not between 5 7pm . good quality sushi . great drink prices all the time . my girlfriend took me here recently , again one of those places that are facebook famous for me , as in i've seen friends check in and post pics of plates stacked high but i've never gone . our check in even got 2 comments of why we didn't invite them ! we had about 6 7 plates between ourselves and were stuffed . also we ordered a sakibomber and for $ 5 yes five dollars ! we got a large sapporo beer and saki . needless to say i had to give up my keys after finishing that . our total bill came up to about $ 25 with tip . i actually can't wait to come back again and you're all invited next time i promise !
great spot . was in and out in less then 8 min . ron was amazing , offered me something to drink and had great customer service . i would definitely go back .
wanted to try a new place out for breakfast . i remembered this place so i decided to check it out . i have to say i looked over the reviews before hand , of course , and was a little jaded by some of the bad reviews . i arrived and was greeted and seated right away . it looked like a very nice place . small but not tiny and pretty busy . i saw on the chalkboard in front that the blueberry pancake combo was featured today . i thought it was a special but saw it on the menu and realized it was just featured . so server came over and was very nice . took the drink order . those came back pretty quick . then placed the food order . he was very helpful even with a very particular special order . food came out in a timely manner and piping hot . pancakes were a good size and very good . blueberries were fresh . bacon was nice and thick and just right . eggs were done just the way i had asked . everything was very good . even tried one of their biscuits . how can you not when that is the name of the place and they were really good too . pancakes really filled me up could not finish . stuffed in a good way . overall , i thought the food was great , service was good and fast , the prices weren't bad and the place was nice and clean . i don't understand the bad reviews unless they came on a bad day or not everyone can be pleased . don't know but i will be back to try out some of the other stuff on the menu that looked good . it was nice to find a new place for breakfast especially after some old favorites have gone down hill recently .
they are trying their best to give great friendly service and they do well doing it . i have to give them props for that . but thats where it stops . the food and the atmosphere is not my thing . i will hang out at hooters at the az center any day overt the kilt . i wonder how long they will be around with the nba season being cancelled . wish them all the best as i support downtown business .
when attending university activities , this restaurant was always the first options for take out , and it never disappoint me .
love lift us up where we belong . where the eagles cry . . . sorry for the 80s moment there , but standing in front of the floor to ceiling windows at the top of the mandarin oriental , it's easy to get caught up in thoughts of flying . and the love bit ? well , i love a well mixed martini . and it's not just the incredible views of las vegas blvd . below that make a mandarin bar martini excellent . the drink menu was expertly crafted . classic drinks blend with contemporary infused vodkas and cucumber seasoned gin . the mandarin bar might be the peak of elegant vegas cocktail culture . hell , the bar is situated high enough . beyond the alcohol's geographic heights , the drinks are also crisp and imaginative . it's brilliant . it's chic . it's over priced . it is without a doubt a highlight of vegas and yet so overpriced $ 20 martini anyone ? that it's not worth visiting more than once every six months . argggghhh . so close and yet so insanely expensive .
this is a wonderful pet care center . the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly . i highly recommend this facility to your attention .
everything was pretty much perfect during our stay at the sanctuary resort . we arrived around noon and had reserved a casita but ended up in a beautiful , large suite . we were there to celebrate my niece's birthday and to wish her well before her deployment . our deck was huge with plenty of lounge chairs , seating , and a patio table . we enjoyed watching the bats at night from this spot , and i enjoyed early morning coffee at sunrise . huge tv , two double beds mattresses were not that comfortable , beautiful bathroom , tub , shower area . we had a great experience upon arrival with brett . he was awesome ! check in was a breeze . we were given bottles of cold water and brett got us a couple buckets of ice . we spent several hours in the pool , having drinks , eating delicious food . capped the day off with time at the spa . up early the day of check out we did a walk around the beautiful resort , packed up and were on our way . we've had both happy hour and food at jade previously , great experience . every staff member we encountered was a professional , excellent service . place was upscale , gorgeous and quiet . the views , beautiful ! we will definitely stay there again . coffee in the room was pretty awful but we walked to the spa for iced tea and coffee to go . great spa shop next to the fitness center .
really enjoyed their food , ordered some food for delivery and it was all very delicious . will definitely order from them again
so while visiting noticed my hands and feet could use a little tlc . stopped in a couple of nail salons but all required an appointment or just couldn't accommodate , after a few attempts we almost gave up . decided to try just nails spa and wow ! tom and his staff were great . unlike other salons i've visited they take their time with each client to give them the best service . tom was so meticulous with my hands to make sure they were polished to perfection which i can appreciate . i will definitely be stopping by here on my future visits out here ! thanks for the great service !
had such a fun night at churn from the time i walked in the employees , especially jake , were friendly and helpful in choosing flavors . the coffee and butter pecan were delicious and i fully enjoyed eating my ice cream on the adorable outside patio . definitely a great date spot or a place for friends to hang out after dinner .
this place brings something cuisine wise that i had yet to encounter in montreal . the food was delicious and different . in terms of the actual restaurant it is more of a snack bar set up . smaller groups 4 or less are fine , otherwise it seems like the wait will be long . the decor was nice sort of like an indian diner . a lot of thought has gone into the food , drink selection and decor . it feels original . it's wes anderson's darjeeling limited x montreal urban food scene . there's sort of an uncomfortable reality of the place that was mentioned by another reviewer indian food by white people for what seems to be a largely white clientele . overall , worth a visit as the food is impeccable , the atmosphere fun , and it inspires thoughts of traveling to india .
the lovely imran n invited me to hang out with his friends ryan and priyank after yelp's grown up pizza party event . what a delightful surprise . i detect a new love affair . the chicken taco i ordered was delicious , ordering it spicy was the right choice . i had a bite off of imran's steamed bao and omg i never would have imagined this delicacy ! next time , you will be mine baby ! the place is a little hole in the way with possibly only 4 5 tables and an extremely small bar seating area . keep that in mind when ordering in ! i can not wait to return and introduce this place to others !
papusas here are delicious ! so coming back for more ! good price for the size of the papusas too .
overall we had a good experience at red , but i do think they could make some improvements . we arrived for our 9pm reservation , and were told they were getting our table ready . we requested a bar table when we made the reservation through open table . we were not sat until 9 40 pm , and were told we could not sit in the bar area . the hostesses did not apologize for our late seating or offer an explanation . however , we were immediately approached by a manager who offered to comp our appetizer , which was nice . we were there for restaurant week , and ordered the mussels , french onion soup , stuffed pepper , filets , and lobster mac and cheese . all of the food was wonderful . i will say that my filet was more on the rare side , and had an odd char on parts of the steak . overall though , it was very good . even though it was restaurant week , the food was very basic . i am not sure if we ordered off the regular menu if they would have done more than just filets with steamed broccoli . the mussels were excellent . the service was pretty good , except for the seating issue . our server was very nice . the overall ambiance was odd , you can tell they built the restaurant very quickly and there is still some construction going on . the bar was very bright and the music was turned up very loud it did not create a nice lounge like experience compared to other high end bars around pittsburgh . we were not drinking unfortunately , but we looked at the cocktail menu and the cocktails were $ 13 $ 15 . this seemed slightly pricey for pgh , but would have been ok if the bar area was more romantic high end . i am not sure if i would go back because considering the prices , there are many other restaurants in pittsburgh that offer a much better dining experience overall .
every time i have been to this location i am frustrated and disappointed . the shakes either have too much ice that wasn't blended correctly , or rude staff that can't remember what you ordered . i asked for two shakes and paid extra for add ins which they didn't put in . both shakes tasted like the ice or flavoring was rotten . asking them to remake it took another 10 minutes and i ended up being late for my appointment . even the remade shakes tasted like sour old water ! horrible service ! there were over 5 people working there and they couldn't figure out how to make two simple orders right ! never ever coming back here again !
happy lemon does make me very happy ! when you first walk in and see the cute statue of the happy lemon girl . also all the drinks are made with lemon and i love citrus ! location at midland and finch in the newest it spot for food and drink . there's a lot of other bbt spots . don't get distracted parking there's a lot of restaurants and a lot of people . i've been here a few times and haven't had trouble parking . decor it's pretty minimal but it's not like you are there for the atmosphere ! they have tables you can sit at and chat but it seems like most people just grab and go . the goods everything has lemon in it . it is happy lemon after all . they have teas , slushies , salted cheese crowns , etc . you can add tapioca , pudding , qq , jellies , . my personal favourite is the lemon kumquat green tea . i get it with regular sugar because kumquat can be really sour ! my friend got an oreo one before and loved it . the salted cheese crowns are popular . they also sell bubble waffles . regular and chocolate . they make it to order and it tastes and smells fantastic ! staff people are nice and helpful and make great recommendations !
we ordered chicken fajitas for two for my birthday dinner tonight . it was completely tasteless ! as in absolutely zero spices and completely dry . there is some machine that they keep running constantly that has a worn bearing or something and just has this constant high pitched sound that blasts your ears the entire time you're there . i wish the owners at el toro would take lessons from other restaurants in the area to figure out how a fajita is supposed to be made . it was just an overall unappetizing experience . 6 months later . alright , so we are trying this experience 6 months later . it's january 1 , 2018 and they finally fixed that machine ! but unfortunately , not the food so much . i am finally submitting a picture . absolutely zero spices flavorings ! just totally plain bland . guess i'll try again in another 6 months ! agave was closed for the new year and yes , we drove there first this was a last resort for mexican cuisine . from the image , you can see how there's nothing but plain ness and bland . the one star will stay for now .
i was a little hesitant to try this place out but i'm glad i did . clean place with servers that are willing to help you out with the menu . their spicy wonton were good , but most people go for their self serve hot pot !
do not come here ! i came with 4 people and my 5 year old daughter to bowl . i requested two lanes of course because my daughter can't play without the rails . the manager at the front told us that we could not get two lanes unless we have 7 ppl , which is ridiculous if you have children . it's not like we wouldn't pay for both lanes . every other amf we went to we did not have a problem getting two lanes . he told us that other lanes were reserved , which is the biggest bs . there were 20 other lanes open . guess what ? the 20 other people that he said reserved lanes never showed up . imagine that ! my 5 year old daughter was sad all night long because she kept throwing the ball in the gutters . we received a very bad customer service from the manager for an unknown reason . almost 2 hours later still 20 empty lanes one of the employees comes and tells us we can play on two lanes . we had that two hour all u can bowl deal , which was almost over . we will never come here again .
delicious ! in every way . service on point . nicholas was awesome . food delicious . came on anniversary and valentine's day .
great subs as always ! i used to go to another location and was always impressed by the food and service . the servers always greeted you and were kind , however my experience at this location was totally different . no greeting when you came in and all the employees seemed to avoid eye contact with me . weird . but i moved on and proceeded to tell my order to the less than enthusiastic cashier who also appeared to be the manager . then when the server brought our food she just left the sandwiches in front of us without a single word . oooookay ? however i noticed that when some of the previous guests left , they were accompanied with a goodbye ! and thank you ! from the employees , but when my mom and i were leaving , they all pretended not to see us leaving as i said thank you ! aloud . hmmm . maybe they didn't hear me , so i said it again and still nothing . honestly i don't understand why the different treatment , i'm always nice and courteous . and because of this uncomfortable feeling my mom and i had the entire time i will only give it 2 stars . really disappointing guys , your subs are amazing but your service sucks .
advisory to groupon users you are not getting much discount since the deal means you only get $ 5 off per person for the $ 21 $ 22 on weekends and holidays ayce dinner buffet .
what a great little place in boulder city . have come here twice and each time was a great experience . on my most recent visit was a friday night and it was busy upon arrival . which was around 7 30 pm . it is a small place about 10 tables inside , counter with a few seats and a few more tables outside . many good beers domestic and craft . but the best part are the burgers ! we got two burgers . one with fries , one with onion rings . the fries were fine nothing special . the onion rings were delish ! beer battered goodness . we ordered the dillinger burger and the executioner . oh how i wish i was eating one right now ! on our previous visit we ordered the capone and the baron . dillinger bacon and brisket and cheddar holy freaking moly so rich and delicious . executioner grilled onions , jack cheese and thousand island dressing . on sourdough ! the bread just makes this burger exceptional . capone cheddar and jack cheese , grilled onions , bacon , special sauce and fried egg heavenly messy ! baron jack , pastrami , blue cheese and tangy mustard cole slaw . so good i went home and made mustard cole slaw to put on my own burgers ! service is friendly and attentive . do your self a favor and take a trip down to old boulder city !
their hours overall are kind of sucky . like , i don't think they're open on sunday . i love pizza on sunday . oh , how i do . sunday is my lazy day i don't do shit ! , so having a nice piece of pizza pie while i dutifully color an aladdin coloring book or watch mst3k flat on my back is great . they're also not open very late . if you only want otto's on a friday night , you're fucked . however , they are very good . i love their pizza . i love it . i ate there not too long ago and the pizza was not nearly as good as it was in the past , but it was a fluke , thank god . it's not pizza that's going to be world famous , but there's a certain and specific taste to the crust , the cheese , the toppings . i don't know what . it's taste made for me and i want to have a large pizza made for me , the size of a car , baked all around me , and i want to eat my way out of it . also , i love their desserts .
amazing breakfast and even more amazing was the service ! amanda was sweet , friendly , and most of all genuinely happy to help . the potatoes are out of this world and so are the banana muffins !
this is real italian food , best in toronto . everything is handmade and homemade including their pastas ! love being repeat customers
visiting from pa and was told this place was good . they are lucky they are not in pittsburgh or savannah ga because the food was less than memorable . their wood fired pizza tasted very plain and certainly had no flavor of wood fire cooking . bland sauce made us unable to finish it . salad was drowned in dressing and again did not live up to the menu description . service was very good but i would not go here again or recommend this food .
had the killer shrimp bowl with crab and lobster was delicious great flavor . the server mika was great very attentive and friendly server .
great service and treatment . very welcoming office staff . dr matt is great , very caring and effective in his treatment .
dish tacos pescados the corn tortillas were old , and they cracked . the mahi mahi was overcooked . the chipotle glaze was unnecessary . price mid teens they charged us dinner prices for a 1 pm lunch . service slow it was about an hour for the food to be delivered . the staff was polite though . verdict not a good place for dining i won't eat there again , but i may go for drinks after work if i'm feeling tequila . at least the kitchen wouldn't be able to mess that up .
the tacos are amazing ! especially the pastor . and omg they have limes civilization is alive in the valley of the sun ! they have burritos , quesadillas , and enchiladas , which i'm sure are just as good , but i always end up with the tacos . they're just too good to pass up . prices are reasonable , except the $ 1 . 50 they want for a refill on drinks what ? ! . don't get any hot peppers on your food ! the place is small , so if you've got a bunch of people you might have to split up at different tables , there are only two and four seaters . it seems to be pretty clean , even the onesie bathroom isn't super gross . my only concern is the sketchy neighborhood . its not the sketchiest place i've ever eaten tacos that honor goes to friendly's gas station tacos in dallas , tx ! , but let's just say i wouldn't be comfortable stopping here after sunset . the bar next door looks like they plucked it straight up out of a mexico city barrio some scary stuff going on in there , i'm sure of it . like they need a concertina fence around the parking lot , seriously . daytime is the time to come here , enjoy your tacos , and get the hell out . situational awareness should be stressed , however , even in the sunshine !
everything was good with this place until we switched to a smaller storage shed , in the last month our shed has been gone through and left open twice . my things have been hanging out , ripped , and stolen ! if you can't do your job and keep my property safe than why should i pay you to do so ? i do not recommend this place at all , that is unless you don't mind losing a few things . today when i called i talked to a lady supervisor who refused to give me their district managers number and instead treated me like crap and said we have camera but they don't record the storage sheds ! i highly suggest if you have important things here you switch to a different storage facility .
this place is good , but i don't know if it hangs on the top coffee shops list for me . first off , the vibe is great . there is a live dj killing it . love that . secondly the decor is sort of bohemian hipster meets contemporary flea market . super cool ! got a macchiato that was tasty and then wanted cold brew , but the best they had was an iced americano , which is 1 of 2 things that makes this 3 stars instead of 4 . i got the chorizo quiche , which was incredibly tasty , but came out cold after the people forgot about my order . so i enjoyed it , but not as much as i could have . haha . next time i'm in phoenix , it's a high possibility i'll return and see if i can give it a 4 or 5 next time .
this place makes the best pizza in arizona ! fresh and fast delivery ! great tasting pizza and salads ! keep up the great work !
this place was great ! scottsdale is not my usual stomping ground so i went based on a recomendation and was not dissapointed . i had the beet salad which was delicious and a side of fingerling potatoes . i am very picky about my fingerlings and these were prepared perfectly ! my girlfriend and i shared the pineapple upside down cake for dessert and all i can say is yum ! definately worth the drive .
are you freaking kidding me ? best f ing steak i've had ever . it was probably due to the slathering of foie gras butter on top . sure it's expensive , sure it's extravant , sure they play house music during dinner . it's vegas people . do it big or go home .
i cannot emphasize enough that this is a must visit , the sign is iconic , it's classic vegas , you'd be stupid not to stop and snap off a few pictures for the memories it only takes 10 minutes . there is a small parking lot located in the median , fits about 10 cars worth . mid afternoon onward it gets pretty busy , but traffic moves in and out rather quickly . the easiest time to go is bright and early in the morning when most of vegas is just stumbling into their hotel rooms for the morning .
not sure why everyone hypes this place up . sure , it's healthier food , but it's extremely flavorless and dry , especially for around $ 10 a plate . customer service left much to be desired cashiers acted like i was some sort of inconvenience , never smiled , were very short with me and i found a few dead earwigs on the floor near the bathrooms . i won't be coming back .
i adopted a dog several years ago from scottsdale pet hotel , and continue to board her here whenever i go out of town . the employees always remember me and my dog , which is very nice . even though the kennel doesn't have runs , i always see them outside walking dogs , so the dogs get plenty of outside time unlike at petsmart .
you have to like total wine . why ? because if you are coming there you want booze and you want it for a cheap price . i used to go to other places but i will go out of my way to come here because i know i will save overall . yay for alcohol !
i first played at braeben when it was still called britannia hills . back then , you could still smell the garbage and the adjacent land was still a landfill . there were not very many houses around the course either . since that time i played the academy 9 hole course a number of times . i liked the academy because it was very challenging for a short course . if you miss the fairway , there was a very high chance that you would lose your ball in the rough and or fescue . the fescue is baaaaad . don't even bother trying to hit out of it . i finally decided to try out the 18 hole course after years of procrastinating . i played on a sunday afternoon at 3 01 pm twilight starts at 3 pm , and super twilight at 5 30 pm . for $ 65 you get a cart for your 18 holes . i highly recommend getting a cart . there are a lot of hills and you won't enjoy your round if you had to carry your bag . both the 9 and 18 hole courses are very well maintained . there are some tough spots we played after it rained and the bunkers can be brutal . we took free drops instead of playing out of the bunkers , especially after rain . also a couple of the holes had very strange layouts . there were two greens that were absolutely hidden and nearly impossible to aim for unless you had played it before . thankfully all the carts are fitted with gps devices so you know how far you are from the green . the staff and marshalls were all very polite and kind . we had a slow group but the marshall tried her best to keep everyone moving . their service really stood out to me . i would definitely play braeben again . for $ 65 and the convenience of the course's location , i think it's a great value . you might have a tough time if you're a beginner because of the fescue and tight fairways , but there are some easy par 3s and straight 4s to keep you going .
my first time using their service and it was smooth and very easy . made my appointment online and got a $ 10 discount . i had my iphone 7 plus battery replaced and it took less then 30 minutes .
i've been eating at garcia's for over 30 years , they have some of the best mexican food in the valley . it's nice that it's been family owned all these years and keeping the same recipes and consistency . their green chile is the best in the valley
my family and i were back in town for a steelers game , and visited pipers's afterwards . i had been a couple times before , and even thought the place was hopping with the after game crowd . this place exceeded expectations ! our server , though busy , was attentive and helpful . the beer was great . and the food ? fantastic ! all four of us loved out meals . highly recommended !
legit chinese inside a casino in vegas ? what ? yes , it does exist . it may be pricier than heading to chinatown , but its in the strip so if you are just visiting vegas its a good option . i'm pretty sure someone on management just hired the people from their favorite chinese restaurant to run this place because the english was sketchy and the food was legit . unfortunately it was a little hard to determine what was actually vegetarian so i just ended up with a very simple noodle dish . but all my meat eating friends left very happy .
what a find amazing desserts and sweet treats and open 24 hours a day . if you are craving something more meal like especially at 2am the arancinis are a must . otherwise , my favorites are the wide selection of italian cookies , where i can choose just a handful of each kind and make my own variety box . service is friendly and helpful , and prices are reasonable .
very stylish and minimalistic . lots of natural lighting and white space , including an outdoor patio perfect for ig opps . i wish i ordered a latte with the colourful latte art because i wanted iced chai latte instead it was a humid day . oh well , next time !
greatest salon ! service is fast and polite . price is just right .
the perch is an interesting place cute brunch spot by day , hip bar restaurant by night . i've only tried the latter , but i was very pleased situated in the corner of container park , overlooking the main stage area , the perch is aptly named . the interior decor is bright and charming , and in the morning daytime it takes advantage of the ample ambient light streaming in through the big windows . location wise , it's fantastic . it feels secluded , and it definitely doesn't feel like vegas . the mornings are nice and quiet in this area . i tried the cornflake french toast , and it was absolutely delectable . french toast is my 2nd favorite food , so i've had it a bunch of times in a large number of places , and this was definitely one of the best . be sure to check in and take advantage of your free pour ! i'd be curious to come back at night and see what it's like for dinner . last but not least , the waitstaff was courteous and kind .
we waited more than 45 minutes for wings and fries . the wings were lukewarm . the fries were soggy . our friends ordered a veggie wrap and veggie burger . they were also cold . the server didn't give a crap , never mind apologize . it was also uncomfortably loud . we couldn't hear each other speak then , and we can't hear anyone speak now . how did the food taste ? who knows ? we were too hangry to care . this was the first restaurant we went to in pittsburgh . at that time they had just opened and they were lovely and friendly with delicious wings . we were super psyched to come back , but i don't think we'll make that mistake again .
i visited a healer's hand after purchasing a groupon . i read some negative reviews right before my appointment and was considering cancelling . i am glad i decided to check it out , though ! i had a great experience . kristen was very professional made me feel at ease immediately . my wax was quick , thorough , and relatively painless . i was so pleased that i purchased a package for several more waxes . this was one of the best prices i found for waxing in the area and it is definitely a great value !
this restaurant is amazing . they really go above and beyond for customer service ! the food is good . it's definitely a fair price for everything they offer . with a fancy drink and food for two , you're looking at less than twenty dollars a person . when you include the atmosphere and quality , it's more than fair . the drinks are definitely a selling point , very good and underpriced . they give out free samples in a regular basis . your food may take a little time in busy hours , but it comes out rather quickly , is tasty , and exactly as described . the internet is fast and they have both wall outlets and usb chargers strategically placed throughout . the atmosphere and layout is fantastic there is no bad seat in the house . i cannot wait to bring friends and family here !
excellent patties ! a buddy of mine is a patty fiend , so when we heard about patties express we had to give it a shot . a tiny spot on elm street , this place is made for patties to go . beef mild , spicy , extra spicy , chicken curry , and veggie spicy ? are the options . we ordered a 1 2 dozen and tried some of each . the beef patties were plump and moist , with enough filling that we were risking some overflow moments halfway through . flavour was really good . chicken patties were curry flavoured , and also quite delectable . the price is right , and these are the perfect grab and go snack .
the two people at the bowling lanes snack bar really need help . they are working their butts off trying to keep up with this long line . why would management schedule only two people to work on a saturday night ?
take a picture with the coca cola bear ! he'll bit your head for fun ! its great ! they let you take a picture with your own camera , and then they take it with theirs , green screen working and all . the bear is pretty funny , his eyes , ears and mouth move . take a picture with him . you can be the penguin and he'll be the polar bear that rips your head off ! the store is filled with lots of coca cola products , pretty amusing . but upstairs after you get your pictures , they have a soda fountain counter . you must try the coke tour around the world . you get 16 sodas for 7 bucks , its a sample mind you , but its 2 trays with and damn that's a lot of soda . you can totally share with your friends . yes share with them , you'll never drink it all alone . its pretty interesting to try all the different sodas out there . but be warned beverly from italy , damn that thing tastes like battery acid ! but the rest of them are pretty interesting to try . mint soda , orange citrus , its pretty cool , and you'll be amused .
terrible terrible will never step foot in there again to be honest i never loose my temper but the short hair lady working there check in is rude beyond rude i've put up with her for the past year now , because this is my moms doctors office and i help my mom get to her appointments but seriously after today and her snotty roll her eyes hiss at me attitude um no i'm not going back i needed a referral so my mom could see a specialist the specialist office staff have been calling and faxing dr olearys office for nearly a week with no response this referral is very important as mom is on medicare and they demand a referral from the pc so if you want to be disrespected belittled and humiliated then by all means go to this office !
oysters and mimosas ! i came here a bunch of times it's a great spot to hang out and have some great beers . sundays buck a shuck is awesome $ 1 oysters and $ 5 mimosas are nothing to ever complain about . atmospher is great they have booths and lots of room directly at the bar and also tables near the window . if you get the charcuterie board you can mix it up with cheese if you like . overall always a good experience
where do i start ? ! this place is the pits ! i came here with my friend as her guest ! we got in very late , after a 4 hour drive , tired and exhausted ! checked in , drove to our room , opened our door to the room and we were just flabbergasted ! it looked like a crime scene or someone was there trashing the place ! my friend called the front desk to complain and they acted like we were bothering them ! their customer service sucks ! then finally security came with new keys to a different room and he was so embarrassed about the whole situation ! he even took pictures of the room to show the manager ! the next morning we called the front desk to see if they had a shuttle that will take you to the strip , it only takes you to the mall before you get to the strip ! and there is no little store in the resort to buy toiletries or snacks or water ! this is supposed to be a diamond resort and it's more like a piece of rock resort ! i'm an timeshare owner with tahiti village and that place blows this place away ! i felt bad for my friend who was a little embarrassed about this whole situation ! next time we are staying at the tahiti village !
the show is cheesy as heck , but my daughter loves it so its all good . loud pyrotechnics . very stuffy especially if you're an asthma sufferer like me . no restroom inside . meal very tasty . cornish game hen , a piece of broccoli , two small potatoes , a biscuit , apple tart for dessert and everything was seasoned perfectly . tomato bisque was delicious . just the right amount served . our server looked miserable until he very end when we gave him a tip . got this on a buy one get two free after a miserable timeshare presentation , but i would totally do it again . huzzah .
the cafe is located next to planet hollywood . it's a fun themed restaurant with great food . the decor is awesome , real harleys are on display in a conveyer belt pretty cool . the food is tasty . we had the mac and cheese you can feel your arteries hardening ! and pulled pork sandwich just the right amount of bbq sauce and a great bun . the fries are just okay . my friend ordered the bloody mary . it was not impressive , it was clearly a mix . service was okay , they were friendly but there were times we couldn't find our waiter but others helped us . they have outdoor seating
had dinner with five friends here a few days ago . we're from boston and trust me when i say we have good sushi . this restaurant's strength is the ambiance . the view of the strip from the main window is great , and the decor is competitive with the best of them . music is new agey lounge , but i know a lot about this genre and it could be a lot better . the food was fairly good taste wise when compared to other sushi restaurants in its price range . however , it is more than a little overpriced considering the portion size . you are literally getting mere morsels for $ 35 40 . when the waiter brought me my main dish it was something that looked size wise like leftovers from someone else's meal . our total bill was in the $ 350 range and absolutely nobody had enough food . in terms of taste , two out of six dishes failed to impress , one was mediocre , and three were good including mine . overall , probably would not recommend .
had dinner there three weeks ago for the first time . the food was exceptional as was the service . i had the stuffed pepper appetizer and it was one of the best i've had . there beet salad was phenomenal and the blackened scallops were done to perfection . nemo grille is now one of my regular stops .
camden legacy has a ultra strict background check that is insane ! they somehow got into my juvenile records and denied my application process because of a misdemeanor battery charge when i was 16 . they claimed i was waived into adult court never happened ! i have rented from multiple places before and never once did my juvenile record come up . it's non of there business what happened when i was a kid . then to make things even worse after they denied my application they said it will take 2 3 weeks for me to get refunded my 310 administrative fee ! i have a wife and child that could sure use that money and a place to live . this place is a joke ! after reading the reviews it's probably for the best . my wife is scared of rats !
bowls are huge and chocked full of tasty ingredients . got the spicy salmon mango , delicious .
it has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of new york . this time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza , a caesar salad and bread knots . from my memory the pizza was better than i remember but not great . however , the salad was not edible in fact we took it back . the romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime . they took it back without any question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith . who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed . i don't think we will go back .
nice food . poor service . also seemed quite disorganized as to who was seeing which table .
when the same place has punjabi , gujarati and south indian dishes , you cannot avoid doubting authenticity . from the place and people it looked more like south indian place so i ordered dosa to be safe . and it was ok like i expected . but my friends ordered punjabi and chaat and they are extremely disappointed .
wait was ok . cashier was friendly , happy full of energy ! all other employees flat to costumers but energetic to each other . my order was wrong wanted for here but put in a bag , no lettuce but got it . all around ok .
worst . like a fake korean using the term loosely . 416 snack bar , but with terrible food and a shoddy bar selection .
for 17 years i have been coming here when i need hardware stuff . almost every hard to find item i have brought in they have been able to get and most of it has been in stock . it is nice to know , when i was married , i could send my wife in with a sample or a note and they could still fill the need .
awesome service , very friendly , and amazing sandwiches ! if it's you're first time , i recommend the spicy curry chicken sandwich !
i went in just for a pie to go . i purchased a pecan pie . it was middle of the road and a bit dry not as good as village inn pie . service was average and they seemed a bit disorganized . i was expecting a better pie since thats their specialty . the place only had one other couple in it . decor was nothig special and seating was not appealing . a disappointment but may try a dinner . very average at first experience a take out .
they shall think about source out better pastries to match with the quality of the drinks
stayed here one night and loved it the room was nice and spacious plenty of room would definitely stay again beautiful hotel
nice patio , lots of beer , specials on beer and food , attendant and interesting servers . what's not to like ? we had a great time .
happy hour discounts only in the bar ! bean dip is nice to have but not anything special . chips are great . red salsa is horrible . the green is ok chicken enchilada gets a 3 5 pork tamale 2 5 rice 4 5 quesadilla 3 5 iced tea 5 5
i've known crystal for years . she is an amazing stylist and has a knack for finding the best stuff ! i love when her dth comes into town and was so sad when she moved . i might just have to come out to tempe to see her again ! highly recommend crystal and dth
they've just opened , but the staff was so welcoming and patient as we group of 4 ordered . the place is clean and the decor is really cute . we ordered a four drinks cookies cream smoothie , mango smoothie , matcha green tea smoothie , and thai milk tea . every drink was yummy , and i'm super glad they've got stamp loyalty cards . i wish them all the best and will definitely keep coming back . thank you , boba king !
this place nestled in near a sprouts shopping center is probably one of the most authentic cantonese food restaurants out here in phoenix . outstanding food and not too salty . try the dumpling vegetable soup to start . use the bowl to eat your main dishes and rice . try these 3 plates beef and chicken tofu , peking duck , and walnut shrimp . delicious and definitely not expensive for each plate and serves maybe 4 or 5 . cash only so be prepared . you do not need a reservation . are you kidding ? the service is very friendly but understaffed .
i haven't been to this restaurant in years so this time i went to a wedding reception . the new building is nice as well . the reception was set up outside on the patio area and was well decorated . the staff were nice and even though i'm not big on tapas food it was served as different samples and some things were very tasty . i was pleasantly surprised this time around . the one thing that stood out is the parking is in the back of the building and there are signs to lock your cars and hide belongings . maybe there have been car break ins ? not sure but it was a concern for me .
i always come to this restaurant bc i think it is worth coming back to evert year ! only disappointment is they did not have stone crab my favorite . maybe next time . the filet is absolutely to die for and i can never pass up the seafood chopped salad which had every kind of vegetable known in the salad . my opinion this salad is the best in the world !
i would rate no star , told us to pull to the stall to wait . 15 mins later no food ! walked in and they said we're making everything fresh ? like isn't everything suppose to be fresh ? we already seen 6 cars later with food good to go down the drive thru ! bad service ! drive to rainbow if you want mcdonalds
got the chorizo breakfast burrito . it was ok , just a little too greasy for my likings . and when i say greasy , i mean it looked like i killed someone afterwards . i know that the chorizo is greasy , but i have never eaten one this greasy , ever ! if i'm ever strolling by , i might give this another shot and try something else . regardless , i still enjoyed the service .
i had passed many times by this place but never went in . but this time we came in for lunch while walking around trying to decide where to eat . it has such a trendy vibe inside , full bar , and small dining area . but if you go outside , the feel of the vibe completly changes . its more of a romantic backyard setting with umbrellas and if you peek over the wall by the fire place , there even a small hangout area with a teeter totter . the food was great . huge portions too . i had ordered the chicken fingers from the appetizer section and it had about 6 fingers with french fries , that itself had me full . usually you can choose what sauce you want it tossed in , but i asked for the buffalo on the side , and it also came with a side of ranch and ketchup . my friend ordered a burger which was massive and delicious . i wouldn't of been able to finish it . but my favorite part of all was their signature mules . the one i ordered had berries in it .
i have stayed here twice , and both times i stayed in the one bedroom terrace suite with strip view . man , the rooms were just beautiful , and the terrace facing bellagio's fountain is just so breath taking . i do not play in cosmo often but their rooms are always my first choice if i am not getting any offer from mlife . they are expensive , but well worth it if you are celebrating your vacation ! their staffs are all friendly and attentive . my boyfriend surprised me during valentine's days last year and asked cosmo to decorate our room with roses and candles . i will update with photos later but cosmo did a terrific job .
this place is a scarborough legend and hasn't changed much over the last 20 years since i first started coming here as a teen . the menu looks the same . the parking lot looks the same . the interior definitely hasn't changed . even the people look the same save for one or two . but that's what makes any great business even greater the consistency . that and value . for less than $ 10 tax in , you will get fed well here . typically get the banquet cheese and bacon burger and an onion rings . the burger tastes the same as i remembered it . it has that harvey's char broiled well ground beef quality to it . although the bread seems a little different but not sure how . the onion rings also seems from harvey's as they're thin with a crispy salt coating . like harvey's , you can pick your toppings which are typical burger stuff such as tomato , onions , ketchup , etc . now i'm starting to wonder if this is really a harvey's . hmmm . doesn't matter highly recommended for the nostalgia , the late hours , the super chill vibe , and the highly strategic proximity to both the 401 and 404 . rating 5 beautiful things out of 5
not sure why the reviews are so tremendously horrific , but they are ! but i 've been going here for two years now and continue to love it the chicken wings are truly the best i've had i know there is better but oh ! how i love them ! as for the service , it's always good . i will continue to go here !
i've gone a few times for drinks , tried the food for the first time yesterday . i had the 4 cheese baked mac cheese . it was incredibly rich with roasted garlic and grape tomatoes mixed in , and pretty much put me in a food coma . my partner had the steak pie . pie crust was light and flaky , meat was tender , fries came with a side of curry sauce . but lets face it , you're here for the scotch . and if you're not sure about scotch , this is a great place to learn . extensive scotch menu ranging from the affordable 10 year olds to some very expensive , premium 25 year olds , and everything in between . if you're indecisive or still learning , there are some interesting flights at the back of the menu that again range from an accessible try $ 19 or so , to the super premium $ 100 or so . if you're not sure , just ask the staff . not a scotch drinker ? shame on you . although i think i was the only woman sipping scotch last night . there is a short but creative cocktail list focused on more mature offerings with quality scotch , instead of bar rail sludge . beer list is succinct and focuses primarily on scottish offerings , including draft innis gunn yum ! and tennants stout . back patio is huge in the summer . there's also a keyholder system , where you can leave a premium bottle of scotch with them and drink it whenever you come . keyholders include the likes of ron sexsmith . we come here whenever the dude wants to be spoiled with scotch options he cannot get or afford at the lcbo . our waitress gave us a free deep fried mars bar on the house , since my partner was celebrating his birthday . or maybe it's cause we racked up a $ 200 tab ? whatever , it was a really nice touch . someone actually busted out bagpipes while we were waiting at the bar for our table , and played a few songs . wide range of clients . we're youngish late 20s , early 30s , we saw some patrons younger than us , and some old enough to be our distinguished grandparents .
stayed here for the first time this past weekend . went to vegas on whim and ph offered the best price for what i was looking for . centrally located on the strip which made it very easy to go around all the hot spots . miracle mile is very cool and earl of sandwich is open 24hrs . room was not bad , but housekeeping could use a little help . overall satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back .
this is the first time i have been back to chipotle since the sickness issues it was having . i have to say that the place is still very inexpensive for what you get , but the flavor is all but gone form their food . since it is all . made off site it is no . bettwr then food service in terms of taste . it is sad as i used to love them but no more . i tried the new chorizo which was just ok . it was very dry and did . notnhave much flavor . i also had my standard chicken and this also was bland and was tough and dry . the salsa was also lacking flavor and tasted of canned tomatoes . the chips were pretty good bit i don't got here for the chips . overall service was 4 5 and food was 2 5 . overall 2 5 . i won't be back unless they can improve the floor of all the thu inga they make off site now which is about 90 percent of what i went here for .
i'd give them negative if i could . horrific management company . they will try to rip you off . the washer and dryer didn't work for 7 weeks and i complained , but it wasn't until after someone who isn't normally in the office to take my concern seriously . management is rude once moved in . they will try to require you to have cable , over charge in all utilities , treated my son very disrespectfully and if you move out early they will try to over charge everything , not give you the final bill and send it right to collections to try to ruin your credit .
one of the few breakfast places in the aria and there always seemed to be a line in the morning . the food is quite good and they did a good job on making an americano . prices are ridiculous $ 8 for a yogurt parfait ! but this is the case with vegas now . the service is not great . the line is due to the amazing slow pay out process . not sure why it takes so long . on my first visit , the left an item out of my order and gave me a different thing than i ordered . but , it was a happy surprise as the nutella brioche was so good ! the breakfast panini was also great . had hard boiled eggs , ham , cheese , and i assume bechamel sauce . quite rich and decadent . but , a nice treat after late nights .
wow . i'm vegan and haven't had a calzone in a long time , and this place blew my mind . so many vegan options , and they were all delicious . we got the vegan stix , chicken bacon ranch calzone , and the pepperoni calzone . the homemade vegan ranch was so spot on , i could have drank it . i definitely felt super full after this meal , but it was amazing !
we live in fh and have been wanting to try this place . we walked in and the hostess asked us the typical questions . well , she whispered actually . i had to ask her several times to repeat herself . you think she could've at least went up a decibal or two ? no . the music . it wasn't italian , which was disappointing . decor is nice but again , nothing italian about it . the russian waiter was polite , well spoken and accommodating . i ordered a white russian drink . it had no khalua in it ! sent it back . i ordered angel hair with alfredo and chicken . the chicken was nicely grilled , a little cajun ish , which i like . the alfredo was very bland , no amount of pepper would help . the side order of veggies was cool , temperature wise . on to dessert . i had coffee and choc misu or something like that . it was decent . the coffee was very strong and cool temperature wise , not hot . unfortunately , i have no desire to pay that kind of money again for a similar experience . i won't be back . don't think hubby will either .
stayed at this hotel on 7 19 13 7 21 13 . first thing is that i would have expected much better service than what we received . we splurged on a spa suite for our wedding weekend . when i arrived at the hotel to check in , they tell me they can't find my room . i begin to panic , but was able to find a confirmation number from expedia we booked through them . they finally find my reservation just to tell me that they don't have a spa suite available , but will be happy to compensate by giving me $ 100 in slot play . ummm . $ 100 ? ! ? ! i paid nearly $ 700 for 2 nights stay in a spa suite . you want to downgrade me to a regular room which runs about $ 150 a night . so that's nearly a $ 400 difference and you're going to give me $ 100 ? ! ? ! ? ummmm . i think not . if you're going to give me a regular room , then you're going to reimburse me the difference , or you can give me the room i booked in the 1st place . i don't know what their customer service team is thinking , seriously . so i basically had to argue back and forth for about 20 minutes with the check in clerk . finally , she went to go get a manager just before i was about to lose my cool , and suddenly . wa la ! they magically found me a spa suite . so they basically lied the entire time , and when they realized i wasn't going to give in , they gave me what i wanted . i will not ever waste my money on this establishment again . i'll stick to bellagio and treasure island from now on . mandalay bay has a few things to learn about customer service , especially at the rates they charge . i have no problem paying those prices until my efforts and wedding are muddled by incompetence . for incompetence , i will not be paying those prices at that establishment again .
if you want to have a terrible experience rent a car from this agency . they try to change what you ordered and up the price . the service line was 40 people waiting to be helped and many unhappy people . the car pickup and return is no better . do yourself a favor and even if you think this is a good price for a rental car think again . i will never ever do business with this company .
well i went there a couple of times . thought oh my gosh it's so thick and it's cheap . but now i know why it's cheap . i've threw up twice . then decided to take a look at what's inside this pizza . never seen a more undercooked pizza in my life . the wings the overlooked and fell apart as you touch them . then they are also located at the worst place to have a restaurant in airdrie .
mat has handled all of my business contracts and he's as good as it can get ! he is responsive , upfront , gives guidance , attentive , trustworthy , reliable , and is everything you need in an attorney . he is very intelligent and looks at the bigger picture . he's not out to get your money , he truly cares about his clients . his fees are actually really fair for someone of his caliber and i really appreciate everything he's done for me .
stopped in this morning and no one was there . this place is a joke . hours say they are open yet no one is there . surprised to see places like this still in business .
it is amazing , the sushi and the hibachi was absolutely delicious . great service with very friendly staff . have found a new go to spot .
went to the harbors waterpark on wednesday and it was a disaster . 1 . both wave pools were closed . one was all day and the second was due to not having enough lifeguards . 2 . they sold us a drink container that had a dead mosquito plastered to the side . didn't see it till we had already taken drinks . thanks for the zika , carowinds . blegh . 3 . huge line at the lazy river and they made you get off after one revolution . there were tons of tubes to go around and they were still making people wait . 4 . three splash pools open for little kids , no rides for kids too small to be on the big kid rides like the slingshot or the race tubes . our 9 year old was really bummed because he didn't want to play with the babies but he wasn't big enough for the only two other rides they opened . 5 . asked one of the people standing in front of a closed ride why they can't open any other rides . said they were understaffed . i asked where the manager was . said there wasn't one in that day . do you mean to tell me that highschool aged employees were left on their own to manage a waterpark full of children ? 6 . kid threw up at the big splash park . took 8 lifeguards to stand around blocking people and telling them they will reopen in a 1 2 hr . 8 . in a fenced park , they could have simply asked everyone to leave and closed the gates while they sanitized the area and let the lifeguards open other rides for the people to go on . 7 . got a little turned around getting there , so when we left through the waterpark we asked how far is it to get to vip parking . we were told it wasn't far . it was literally the longest trek that could have possibly been . while dragging a tired 5 yr old in a wagon full of stuff behind me . by the time we got to the car , i told my mother n e v e r a g a i n . so , i am really really disappointed carowinds . we were planning on spending practically all our summer there but i'm not sure i want to ever go back .
okay had a good time food was good wife had the prime rib plate for only $ 12 . 00 and i had the average chicken wings 24 for $ 18 . 00 but the cosmo drinks was $ 13 . 00 each and my double jack and coke cost me $ 18 . 00 each with a 2 drink minimum and we were there drinking with friends for 3 hours my bill reached $ 170 . 00 for the two of us to have a good time , not including the tickets . so if you can't afford those numbers drink your specialty drinks at home order a beer or a glass of wine . i was a bit shocked when i got the bill . i guess that's why they gave me some free tickets to come back !
my husband and i don't eat at chain restaurants very frequently . we try to avoid them when possible . saturday night when trying to decide where to go out for dinner we are running out of food in our house , i had a list of places i want to try . however , my husband didn't want to spend more than $ 30 on dinner no clue why , so all of my ideas were out the window . we decided on applebee's since i had a slight craving for a mucho mudslide . the only highlight of our trip to applebee's was my mucho mudslide it was yummy . my fried chicken salad was large for a half size and was pretty good . i'd be concerned if a place could really mess something up as simple as that . my husband got the ultimate trio basically he got to pick three appetizers . he ordered the mozzarella sticks blah . they were barely hot and not as good as they used to be back in the day the sliders what is up with every place , not fancy and fancy , having sliders on the menu nowadays ? , and chicken wraps chris said they were ok . our service was worse than the food . it took over 10 minutes after we placed our drink order for our drinks to appear on the table . no clue why it took that long because the bar area wasn't busy and the bartender didn't look backed up . second , it took our food forever to come out . we have no clue why . a mother and daughter walked in after we placed our dinner order and when i glanced over wondering where our food was , i noticed they were eating ! they got food before we did ! grrrrrrr . our bill came to $ 28 , but it was hardly worth it . on our drive home , we said we should have just gone to wendy's for dinner . better quality food at a much much cheaper price .
tortillas hechas a mano ! excelente service and the food is is delicious . . great find . we came for breakfast and will be coming back for dinner .
love the vibe and the decor , the place gae off a downtown , hipster esque vibe instead of your average sit down restaurant . came here on a saturday night , the place was packed . service was quick , they brought out more fish cake and more tea when we were running low . had the bibimbap . amazing ! you could hear the sizzling from the bowl when it was brought out . the portion was generous , and i was stuffed after eating it . also order corn cheese and marinated spicy pork ribs forgot the korean name , the ribs were packed with flavor and it was so tender that it pulled apart easily . can't wait to go back and try more dishes !
i went for the first time a few days ago . i got an umami bowl and it was excellent . the man behind the counter could tell by how long i was reading the board that it was my first time there and he explained everything to me . food was delicious . service was great . i'll be back .
my nephew and niece , ages 12 and 11 respectively , love this place and talk about it all the time so i thought i'd give it a go . wow ! i'm a fan now . considering it was my first time visiting i was kind of unsure about how to build a pizza so shane walk me through the process . then he turned it over to monica who did the toppings for me , and i requested it's being done well done happy for paul put it in the oven he explained to me well done and the different levels of it and let me choose which one i wanted the most and damn the pizza came out perfect . but i believe the best thing about going to mod pizza here on elliot was the patience shane , paul and monica had with me even though they were working in a fast paced environment . i had a ton of questions and each one of them took the time to explain to me the process each step of the way . as you and i both know , customer service now days is almost a thing of the past and that's why i'm willing to drive 16 miles one way to come visit this place and get a pizza ! great pizza and awesome customer service ? yeah i'll spend my money with you all day ! 32 years in the state of arizona and i finally found pizza that is fresh , great tasting and light on my belly and i don't feel guilty after eating it . lol
love the food , atmosphere and good looking men here . our server was one of the few straight men in there , especially since all my gay friends were trying to make him a switch hitter . prices are decent and drinks are delicious .
a friend and i had lunch there today . it's the first time i've been there . the hostess and our server were very friendly . my friend and i hadn't seen each other for a while and the server let us catch up she kept stopping by to see if we were ready to order . i ordered the coconut curry rice bowl with apples , ginger curry buttered naan bread with chicken . it was interesting as it had kind of a smoky taste . the naan bread would have been better if had been plain . the restaurant is in a wacky spot . down the escalator in the basement . it i was in the yorkdale mall and was hungry for a restaurant rather than fast food , i'd go back .
you know you're getting old when bathroom and kitchen fixtures appliances get you all excited ! love this place ! lissa was very helpful !
my low rating is mainly because of the terrible service at this location the food is the same as any other location . i live and work nearby so this is closest location to me , i do go here often and am repeatedly disappointed by the service . it's obvious the employees don't care about the customers or the service . my advice is to always check your order before you leave if you're taking it to go , they will get it incorrect pretty much every time . they will also forget to add your sides , but still charge you for them !
i purchased some chocolate , underwear , and tank tops here . the selection was good , and the prices were low . i felt uncomfortable with the disabled cashier who spent a couple of minutes holding each of my thongs right up against his eyes and nose to remove cheap hangers that could have just stayed on . don't get me wrong i think that it is great that walmart gives him a job . i was just uncomfortable with this particular situation , even as i sped up the process by helping him myself to remove the hangers . next visit i needed some hygiene and cleaning products , which i was able to pick up for good prices . i also needed a flu shot . the wait at the pharmacy was very long because of the many customers , but i eventually got my flu shot from the nice pharmacist .
got a number 7 wanted to get a quick bite and had high expectations of this place . the sandwich was soggy with old lettuce let me down . i am really happy with the fries they are actually really good and glad that they offer hi c as a fountain drink .
first time getting my car's body repaired , and it was easy . someone hit my car in a parking lot , and it was a hit and run . made a claim through my insurance and these guys handled the rest . it was super easy . jesus took the time to show you what the plan was , instead of just take your money . with a ton of customer service experience myself , it was very professional the way jesus walked outside and pointed out what he could do , how he would do it , and how long it would take . i expected alot less than what these guys did . the paint on my subaru wrx looks like it just came out of the dealer lot . its spot on . they did an amazing job . i'd highly recommend them for any auto body work that you need done .
super bad . i ordered a pita salad and the lettuce that he put into the salad was clearly wilted and going bad . it was pretty much bright orange in color . the chicken was completely uncooked and rubbery , i had to stop eating to avoid getting sick . also i was the only customer so i'm thinking the employee didn't really know how to cook . at all . wish i could get my money back .
came here for my mama's birthday and realized that my family's go to place is always a cjinese restaurant . no matter what state we are in ! here's the breakdown 1 . price check in and get 5 off lunch and 10 off dinner . we ordered a gang ton of food . i'd say around 12 or 13 plates of ala carte . whole bill was $ 193 . 00 . and the . 10 off of that , and then automatic gratuity was added . not bad right ? 2 . service alrrightt . lets get down to the knitty gritty . docked the stars for this one for a number of reasons . one being the wait time . first order came in about 10 minutes later . second platter came in 20 minutes later . all in all , we waited a good 40 minutes for all 12 orders to come in . lol ! so we were already full by the time all food came . fried rice being the last on the table . servers were nice . however , if you are picky about constant attention . you aren't going to get it here . given it was a holiday weekend , it was pretty busy . water took forever too . 3 . food it was ok . we ordered the seafood soup . and boy did it need soy sauce and pepper . could use a bit more seasoning . just sayin' . we also ordered the duck . which was actually pretty good and moist . i would have to advise you not to order the fried chicken though . dry dry dry . and practically burnt . their mapo tofu was delicious ! even just that and some fresh white rice . yum ! they also have this veggie plate called bhudda something . it was ok . wouldn't order it again . overall . this place could be better . would i come back ? sure . would i recommend it to others . ? mmmm , maybe as a last resort .
i really wanted to like this place as i went because of all the positive reviews . we got there and the place was full on a tuesday morning , a good sign . we were seated right away and we brought our drinks . we ordered . as we watched several other people come in and be seated and get their food , we kept waiting . and waiting . 50 minutes we waited as everyone around ate and left . we were about to leave and the waitress said it will be out in a minute . another 10 minutes went by and then the food came . worst service ever . no apologies either . not wasting my time on this place again .
we received our order the other day and we spoke to the driver who had nothing nice to say about the owner . he said that many good people have left because of her !
i saw that rainbow garden offered korean chinese food so i thought i would give them a shot . i ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout . prices were comparable to what i would pay back home near chicago . the portions were pretty decent as well . taste wise the jajangmyeon was good , but not as good as back home . there were lots of pieces of seafood and meat in the sauce , although it was a bit greasy . another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in , they seemed to omit this with my takeout order . not a deal breaker or anything , but little details like this which would gain them another star . the tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy . the sauce was a great balance of sweet and sour and overall it was a solid dish . i'll be coming back to rainbow garden in the future when i'm craving korean chinese food .
the secret is out . think pink spa does the best shellac manicure in the city . they are friendly , quick , affordable and best of all their work his high quality . shellac manicure is $ 30 or $ 45 for a mani pedi . they're wonderful ladies , the place is clean and the manicures last . i'm a regular at this place and never had an bad experience . best of all . they have a loyalty card .
my husband and i had never been before but had heard good things about empire . we decided to go last night with our 3 year old . it was after 7 00pm so i wasn't sure about taking him but we thought we'd try it and if it wasn't kid friendly we would try somewhere else . there were several kids there and the place was pretty packed ! we loved everything we ordered lasagna and 5 boroughs pizza . we also ordered cheesy garlic bread for our son and it was delicious ! the staff was very friendly and service was quick ! we would definitely recommend it ! d
for a fast food joint that specializes in sandwiches these guys kill the competition of subway , firehouse and quiznos . bread is great . the amount of veggies including mushrooms , the amount of sauces including pesto , and the amount of options including gyros blows the competition out of the water . quality is also much better minus the chicken which is about as sub par as the competition . prices are higher but worth it . oh yeah , love the choices of different onions
gina is amazing ! her silk floral arrangements are beyond beautiful ! she really set the bar high . at my wedding i kept getting compliments from people on the arrangements . when i shared that the arrangements were silk arrangements , people could not believe it ! my bridal party was also delighted that i had silk arrangements because they got a take away that will last forever . gina is also extremely easy to work with . she is super responsive , has a great personality , and provided great customer service . i highly recommend her services !
i had a similar experience as most other reviewers . i bought a groupon , made an appointment , had to reschedule my appointment and never got a call back . the professionalism is severely lacking . groupon was very accommodating when i made my complaint against this business .
casey is the man ! he takes care of us every time we go in there ! and jay gave us a magazine ! they are the best smoke shop in vegas hands down ! so friendly and so helpful
i think an update is due as i finally got around to trying the dinner service here . i cherish my visits to this plaza as my fav grocery store is located here . alas most of my trips are during daytime and few and far between maybe that ought to change and with the groceries loaded up i just grabbed a quick lunch on my last visit here . this was a planned visit so i took my time this visit . what i like about this plaza is if you don't sell authentic japanese food you won't last here as it is frequented by people who know what japanese food is supposed ought to be . i came here to try their grilled items specifically as luv binchotan charcoaled stuff . i ordered the takoyaki as its on of the best in the city imo . the unaju looked tempting so had to order it . for good measure also added an order of wagyu skewers . they have an ok beer and sake list which is worth a look . the takoyaki is still its old self i . e . great . the wagyu is decent though i think i will order the mix skewer combo next visit . now for uanju oh boy where do i start i enjoy uangi to an extent that i can devour a whole eel frozen version bought from grocery store without blinking . this is definitely another level . perfectly grilled served on a bed of rice . this is an eel luver dream in gta and worth a detour imo . the specials menu also caught my eye as it had interesting items that aren't so common . lobster miso , a5 rated steak from japan i know its getting more common elsewhere but i think i would like to try it here as charcoal grill has its charm some specials with japanese fish and if you are a sukiyaki fan they even have the wagyu version sourced from famu one has to order ahead if i recall folks i think this is best izakaya in gta ! now only it was in a location where i don't have to worry about driving home and can drink . 4 . 5 stars !
i am a huge procrastinator when it comes to going to the dentist . i put off a visit to the dentist for way too long i came in with a terrible tooth ache and their professional front desk staff got me in to see a dentist right away . i ended up needing a root canal and it was the most painless dental experience of my life ! they certainly live up to their name , gentle dental ! i wholeheartedly recommend gentle dental to anyone looking for a dentist ! thank you berta , oscar , dr . garber , dr . delsnyder !
i absolutely love the food . brought my kids over to eat as hubby is out of town and i did not feel like cooking . plus i know i can watch the cubs game as well ! my only complaint was that i could not have a normal conversation with my family at our table , or even order my food with the waitress as the tv packers football and music played at commercials was extremely loud . i thought it was just me because im old , but i could see others leaning into other peoples ears to talk and i find that to be a real big turn off . i had to repeat myself a few times for each of our orders and she had mention that she was going to ask if they could turn it down , but i didn't notice a difference . as we were leaving , we passed another family that was hesitating to come in , i assured them that the food was phenomenal , but forget the conversation . just text each other . she laughed and agreed . it was too loud . sorry , i hate complaining . so maybe try finding a middle ground ?
terrible customer service . i ordered delivery through just eat and it was an awful experience . the food took almost 2 hours to arrive when the restaurant is right down the street . food was cold and soggy , the restaurant never contacted me regarding delivery issues i had to call them and they weren't helpful at all as well as not offering any sort of discount or something to make up for such an awful experience . they very clearly do not care about their customer service . i will not go to this restaurant again . oh and to top it all off there was a bone in my taiwanese spiced chicken .
i've walked by here many times and recently read they had great shepherd's pie so we decided to try it out . it was an ok experience nothing overly exceptional to write about . the atmosphere is nice very cozy with a fireplace and some comfortable chairs . when we walked in , i thought i would love the place . we sat down and i quickly realized this visit was probably going to be mediocre . first , for an irish pub they have only two irish beers which i find very odd . also , the food prices were fairly expensive for the area . i had the shepherd's pie as desired and my friend had the butter chicken . my pie arrived in a neat stacked fashion but i found it fairly bland and dry . my friends butter chicken was relatively small in portion size . service wasn't exceptional and neither was the food . honestly , i doubt i'll be back . many more places to choose from in the area .
with my relatively new vegetarian preferences , i'll try just about any restaurant with tempeh on the menu . aux vivres rewarded me nicely . great rice bowls , sandwiches , smoothies , and desserts ! food portions were just right for me . i loved the blt , buddha bowl , thai bowl , bombay banana , mango lassi , and chocolate smoothie . food disappointments were the veggie lox sandwich done well but not something i would normally crave and the cafe frappe the flavor wasn't quite right for some reason maybe too much soy milk . during my recent vacation in montreal , i sat at various times at the counter , in the dining room , and on the terrace . i visited for both lunch and dinner , and never had to wait , although the dining room was often near capacity . the interior of the restaurant is nice , although the layout is quirky , and one of our tables was right below an air conditioner that gave us the chills . the servers were almost consistently friendly , and service was quick .
amazing wine in a laid back environment with friendly staff . and how awesome is the hotdog cart ? !
worst pho in town . meat all fat . broth all wrong . number spice amount always wrong . garbage across from college . chinatown would kick them out !
made another delightul foray into hong kong style cuisine , with yet another friend who instantly became a fan not surprisingly . we had the salt and pepper squid , which was so good crunchy and pleasantly spicy , and it came as a generous serving which i've come to take for granted at this restaurant . we also ordered the hong kong style beef stew so flavorful with star anise and five spice this has become my new favorite . my friend was so impressed that he wants us to go again this week . and of course i agreed .
this place is a solid 3 . 5 stars . 4 for the decor , 3 for the food . i swear sometimes i think i'm white . i'm actually asian but bc the majority of my colleagues , coworkers , friends , etc are white , sometimes i don't feel very asian . but then i walk in a place like this , and i instantly feel very self conscious of being a bit out of place . this place is all american . people were clearly looking at me . well , what're ya gonna do ? smile and enjoy a good breakfast of course . despite that , i will be back when i'm in the area for their special . some sort of potato pancake that sounds pretty good .
went for dinner on weekday the food was below par . a little disappointed since i was expected better . i had a cobb salad which was very avg chicken was dry . very casual setting . service was fine . bartender however was very unprofessional . she was talking on her cell phone while waiting on people . she had the cell phone always . at times people were waiting until she finished her calls . amazing . i question the management that allowed it . prepare to be blinded while eating in afternoon or early evening . no shades on windows .
such a great experience to get my kids to try something new . only suggestion is maybe not to go on sunday evenings without asking what they are out of . my son wanted to try a few different things and all 3 they were out of .
this is a great value in las vegas . the show was really good , lots of energy and great songs . the band and dancers were great , and the star was great too . i have spent twice as much for shows half as good . if you like michael jackson's music , you should like this show , and the value is unbeatable .
takes time and explains everything so well . definitely excellent care .
came here with my mom , i got the chicken pad thai and she got the yellow curry . both were excellent ! i will be back to try more on the menu .
a great place for a bowl of noodles . one of only a few places in lv that has authentic hand pulled noodles . service was prompt and the food was good . definitely coming back !
the staff is friendly . i find great deals . i love using the cartwheel app combined with the target app i rather spend a little bit more at target and get good service , then go to walmart at riverview
this is one of the most high end restaurants in toronto . it's also a favourite among celebrities . you always hear some story of some star eating there during film festival . it's super small and cozy and kind of off the beaten track because it's up avenue rd . instead of right in the heart of yorkville . they have valet parking and it's some of the best italian food you'll ever have . be prepared to spend a lot of money and it's near impossible to get a reservation during film fest . two stars that are always there are sharon stone and coin ferrell . just sayin' .
food the food was good . the dishes i would recommend are the octopus tacos and the hakka wontons . drinks this was my favourite part ! i will probably come here for the drinks alone . i had the tom yum inspired cocktail 2 glasses of it . my friend had the one that came in the tiki glass which i think was the mai tai . the drinks were definitely creative and delicious service our server was great and really knowledgeable and patient to help us decide on the dishes . atmosphere without sounding overly old i would say that the music and overall noise level in the restaurant was on the loud side . i only say that because i was there with a few friends and we had to talk loudly to carry on our conversation
i've reviewed over 30 jj gyms in southern california , this is my first one i tried out in vegas . i was honestly expecting very little , but i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the people to roll with there . there were three black belts who i think were all instructors there , but all three of them rolled , so that's good , i believe two browns , and maybe two purple's , although i can only for sure think of one . a couple blue's and quite a few whites , as is the case with most gym . for it being a small gym , the quality of students was good , and if you live in the immediate area as i do , there aren't a lot of other close options . so i'd check it out . seems like it'd also be a good place for beginners . it's pretty relaxed in terms of formality , which i like . i've been inside a couple relatively strict gyms like university of jj , and gracie headquarters in torrance , but i prefer the relaxed atmosphere . i'd recommend checking it out . apparently they teach leg locks to lower belts there at least blue belts , but i assume white's as well , which i also think is a very good idea , it's kind of old school to not and it's ridiculous how much i know , and yet still literally know nothing about leg locks .
a year ago , the spot was our favorite place to go for friday fish fry . they had a nice piece of walleye spiced well and pan seared perfectly . the past two times i have been there , i was served 3 4 small pieces of greasy fish , maybe 2 ounces , definitely not more . the order typically comes with sweet potato pancakes though i often order seared greens instead because i can't eat gluten . but , my partner has ordered them off and on in the past and they had always been large , well seasoned , shredded , pan fried sweet potato pancakes . this last time , they were small , deep fat fried white potato discs . clearly not the same quality or even the same food for that matter . the spot is in our neighborhood , we have been frequent flyers , and while for the most part we have had other decent meals , some inconsistency , will never again order the fish .
worst food i've ever had ! i've been here twice since the new company took over and as a bouncer who used to work here back when it was mez , i can tell you , they have really screwed the pooch on this one . the first time i went must have been right after they opened and the pizza i got was ok . pretty big size but not all that flavorful and too hard to eat . little did i know that compared to the pizza they serve now it would seem like the best pizza in the world ! i went about a month ago and got the never ending pizza and i swear the regular one was a crappy microwavable pizza smaller than my hand and so i then tried the thin crust and it was even worse ! the dough was raw and as limp as a noodle . service is horrendous ! they screw up everything and don't seem to care at all . i think the server laughed when we asked for a refill of our popcorn because he couldn't believe that we called him all the way there just for that . lol . very strange that they haven't looked on here and tried to fix anything . this place will not be open long . why would you make horrible food that is messy at a prime spot in the busiest part of charlotte ? makes no sense ! do not go here !
this was our first visit to tru burger . ivry our server was very nice and explained menu items well . great personality . the california burger was amazing . we tried the green bean fries w wasabi ranch . they were great . excellent experience .
we had a wonder night with a friend from long ago and experienced a fabulous meal with vincenzo s our waiter ! great good with great recommendations for food . mmmmm
straight up amazing . everything hands down satisfying in every way possible . food staff everything great
thus is my second time here . today is not busy at all and i been waiting on my food for over 13 minutes now . service is slow . sort of pricey . not sure if i would come back here .
this the best ever in laveen . andy you out did yourself on this new shop kelly you are the best my hubby will not get his pedicures unless it's by you . we will miss you come back soon .
this has been our regular breakfast spot for nearly 9 years ! we love the traditional benny and the carnitas skillet ! we've had delicious lunches here as well but always crave breakfast ! it is a bit pricey , but the service is speedy , friendly , and efficient ! michelle was great this morning !
the environment here is very nice . staff seemed very friendly and helpful . the cornbread bisquits are amazing . should have just ordered those . the ribs were probably the worst i've ever had . i ate one and couldn't eat anymore . the texture was off . too soggy or something . but i think the sauce is what really made it un eatable . the pulled pork was edible but not too much better . way to soggy . and not juicy soggy but just like water logged . overall very disappointing . i'm a huge bbq and especially ribs fan , and was thrilled when they were building this place . but will probably never go back . midwood bbq down the road is a much better alternative .
the food was good , the service was amazing , they were super polite . i had the enchiladas and the spices were on a good level . would definitely recommend . ps . 1 star if there's wifi
came for lunch with my parents . the building and history behind the place is beautiful . old bank building incredible architecture . food was good smallish lunch menu but everything we had tasted fresh . i had the braised mac and cheese and the cheese wasn't too overly cheesy or heavy . would like to come back and try dinner
i really like this place . i've gone to the original location on 10 av several times . have been now to the new location formerly giant hamburger and nothing has changed in terms of quality . i feel the chicken is fresh and delicious . i wish they had wings specifically here but am happy with other options . if you like fried chicken you should try this place , as it is currently my favourite in the city , but the fries and onion rings are relatively average .
i had to stop by garrett popcorn shops after reading a tip from a yelper saying that garrett popcorn shops is popular in chicago . i love popcorn , so i thought why the heck not ! if you plan on getting some to bring home , i suggest you go the day of or day before you leave vegas because garrett's doesn't use preservatives in the popcorn , which is always good . i tried the milk , cheese , and butter popcorn and bought 2 small cheese and 1 small butter . the total was about $ 12 a little pricy for popcorn , but it is vegas , so everything's expensive . milk caramel popcorn with milk chocolate warning if you have a nut allergy , don't get this ! the employee informed me that they pop this popcorn on the same equipment that they pop the other popcorn with nuts on . that aside , the popcorn was delicious ! it was probably one of the best they had and i really regret not getting a bag of this flavor . cheese my second favorite and the one i ended up taking back to my boyfriend . i really loved the strong cheese flavor that was mixed with their fluffy popcorn ! this was definitely a hit with the kids . butter strong butter flavor ! perhaps , too strong . it almost tasted like there was a stick of butter in the bag , which i didn't really enjoy too much . if you're a butter lover , this is definitely for you ! overall , i think it's definitely worth a trip to miracle mile shops to get your popcorn fix .
came here on a recent trip to calgary and had very high hopes . i used to be a big fan of nellie's on 17th ave though i just found out about their health violation business . eeps ! and i also adore marda loop . overall it really wasn't that bad , but it wasn't that great either . the cherries for my stuffed french toast were just cherry pie filling from a can , which while delicious at first , is just way too much and too rich . i was also astounded at the fact that my side of bacon cost almost $ 4 and i only got 3 sad looking pieces . i really do enjoy the space and location though . it's clean , bright , well laid out and all the serving staff were quite friendly . plus , you can't go wrong hanging out in marda loop .
ordered the cheese omelette and added bacon and onions . it came with potatoes and toast . maybe just my taste buds but despite the reviews i read , the rosemary seasoning is overwhelming and the potatoes seem undercooked . looking at empty plates as i left , i see lots of uneaten potatoes so i suggest the chef rethink their recipe . valentin was my server and he was good and the speed of service was good . the toast is about 1 2 inch thick and more like a dessert again not my cup of tea but whatever . crossing this place off my airport stops will stand in line at wendy's next time . sorry !
excellent slice of pizza . meat was on delicious . cheese was gooey . what else do you need ? it's pricey though . but good snack before the show at laugh factory !
tony was such a great help amazing to work with . he helped my husband get a car , with really bad credit . we desperately needed it , they worked with us to get a car for our needs . we had some unfortunate circumstances happen where we needed a 2nd car , again tony took care of us working with our budget to get another car . he was well educated with questions we had , was so nice to our children . he got us out of a really bad situation we are so thankful for his help . definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase a car , or if your credit isn't that great .
we have been here twice in two weeks and the food is very good . nice portions , fresh food , served hot . the restaurant itself is clean and spacious although i'd like to see a little more attention given to the drink area where customers don't take great care in serving their own soft drinks and leave a sticky mess . otherwise , no complaints about cleanliness or organization . the only thing keeping them from obtaining their fifth star is the speed of service . the line moves pretty slowly . not exactly sure if that's the customers ahead of us who don't know what they want or what . but both times , it's been pretty slow getting from one end to the next . otherwise , no complaints . good food . friendly people . nice environment .
not impressed with wednesday night trivia here . the music is playing too loud in background , servers are polishing silverware and singing happy birthday , making it hard to hear the questions . server , shawn , was intrusive , telling us answers to questions . did we invite you to be on our team , shawn ? no . not sure we'll be back .
amazing ! the gluten free mac and cheese was to die for accompanied by a perfectly poured pint ! good service , clean and reasonably priced . perhaps a couple of dollars more than pub food but the the quality of food is far superior . duck confit , truffle oil and so on . no frozen foods here . overall , money well spent . i will be coming back for certain . most likely in the next week
i went to see dr vogel today for my first pain management visit . i've been treated by my primary care physician for pain for five years . i waited for four hours to be told nothing is wrong with me and i didn't sustain a brain injury in a rear end accident . i believe this was dr vogel's pa . i left bawling and refusing treatment as this has already been a struggle for me as a single mother of a young child . i've just been getting through everyday . i wish a steroid and anti inflammatory would help . if you want to be treated like a drug addict that trying to fake injuries this is the pain mgmt office for you .
we've tried a couple entrees one night and they were over sauced and bland . the only real highlight at this place is the garlic knots , very good . i've gotten the two slices lunch special two times . and each time i've gotten offered different things and different prices . it's supposed to be 5 . 95 for two slices and a drink . last time i got toppings included and a huge cup for my drink . this time i had to pay extra doesn't state anywhere that toppings are extra and got a small cup and the kid couldn't even fill it up . pizza is pretty run of the mill . greasy and kind of bland but hey for a cheap quick lunch it works . the short dark haired female manager or owner not sure which was reprimanding an employee in front of the restaurant , apparently he was doing roll ups in the wrong area and she felt the need to let us all know . he was actually the best service i've gotten there . shame she doesn't understand customer service or etiquette . i'll be back just because it's close to my house .
i would give rita's italian ice 5 stars but they don't carry chocolate italian ice a matter of fact they don't have chocolate italian ices in the whole state of arizona , why i don't understand , chocolate and cherry together is the best . moved here from the east coast and its the best seller there , but not surprised when i see a line at the hawaiian shaved ice stand and not at rita's wake up arizona you don't know what you're missing !
this is the worst place on earth . come here if you want to be disrespected ! we paid over 2k for a table and the staff proceeded to lose all of are belongings and make us feel like we spent nothing .
one of the best pho i've been to ! love it . soup's delicious and people are very nice . and it's clean as well ! price is very reasonable so is the quantity ! highly recommend it !
just had botox and juvedern completed on tuesday . oh gosh , even though a slight bruise on lower lip , i can tell these are turning out incredibly wonderful . the staff was great . they run a very nicely time managed office . alissa was very nice . melanie is first class . i've gone through botox and fillers before , this was so professional . you could tell she knew exactly what she was doing ! she also took time to go over skin care products and other services . i never felt pressured , but i will be back again !
love this place . food is clean and tasty . the most important thing is here is $ 1 2 cheaper than other all you can eat sushi places and they still have good quality of oyster , uni , sweet shrimp , sashimi salad , etc ! good good
i'm happy this place opened up at the galleria mall a few years ago . it's a great neighborhood place to drop in for a tasty brew and a bite to eat . last night , i tried the black and bleu flatbread and it was delicious and a good size i was plenty full after eating half of it and two beers ! . michael tried the pork schnitzel and said it was good , but a bit bland . i tend to find all schnitzel bland , but that's just me . the tavern pretzel is a favorite there although we didn't order it this time . the place gets a bit noisy , with sports on the many flat screens and all of the lively conversations going on . but we were still able to hear each other at our table . there's a nice outdoor patio area , as well . we've sat there a few times in the past , and enjoyed it .
good service , courteous , lots of available vehicles to choose from , even on christmas eve . this facility operates a little differently from others in that you don't just go straight to the car . still , even on a busy holiday the service was efficient and relatively quick . the vehicle was clean and the rate was fair .
in my quest for finding decent , fast , cheap , delicious all you can cram aycc indian restaurants , this is absolutely a must eat . i don't know how much it costs since a friend of mine bought me lunch , but i know how he rolls . so it can't have been more than $ 14 . i had a thorough sampling of several types of meaty deliciousness and i was not disappointed . the rice was ok , but the naan was spectacular . you can even see the chap making them at a breakneck pace . the veg items were all just as tasty and i even tried a fish dish that was excellent . the menu changes constantly though depending on how much of what flora or fauna they can get at the best price per tonne . i didn't try any of the desserts as i was all crammed up by the time i had finished sampling the meats , carbs and veg . they did have a large display case of what looked like traditional indian sweets , and various baked goods , but alas i was stuffed and was having difficulty maintaining the integrity of the waist button my pants as clearly my pants had shrunk during the meal . as for ambiance , there are plenty of authentic looking customers . additionally , the teenagers in the parking lot sporting beat up tuner cars and lousy moustaches seals the deal . their mom's clearly approve of them eating here for lunch . it must be good great food in copious quantities at a price even a starving artist like myself can afford . i'll be back for more !
yikes . i have been waiting on submitting this review since i just could not find the right words for this place . like si said earlier , this is not my typical scene . i am uncomfortable in bars . generally , i am crying into my heinously over priced , poorly mixed drink in the corner . but that is not relevant to this review at all . pfff . i am not cool enough to understand why people like this place or why it is cool . this has to be one of the smallest dance clubs ever constructed . are these cramped quarters good , so that someone is guaranteed to unknowingly grab your ass at some point in the evening ? also , the layout for the place , with two different mixes of house music permeating both floors , is obnoxious . it truly feels like the cool peeps are dry humping each other upstairs , and the not so great peeps are downstairs wishing they were upstairs . the cover was $ 7 . wtf ? i can think of millions of different things i could spend my cash on . but don't relax just yet , we haven't even explored the deplorable cost of drinks . this must be the place that paul rudd was referring to in 40 year old virgin , when he states yeah , it is $ 9 beer night . $ 7 for a gin and tonic , that freaking cocktail served us . i loved the fact that because i wasn't dancing vigorously or did not have huge , fake breasts , that it took him like 12 minutes to figure out we were there . this place is horrible . the icing is the fact that these huge bouncers plop themselves triumphantly in every corner , just waiting for the chance to push scrawny punks out of the way . all i can say is this is not my kind of place and i am totally ok with that .
once upon a time , downtown pineville was a deserted wasteland of yarn shops , antiques and hair salons . there was rarely any life on the streets and as a young adult who lived here , we had to drive allllllll the way to the center of the city if we wanted any type of craft beer . when the tiny wooden sign that said pintville appeared one day , my husband and i rejoiced with anxious glee ! and finally the doors opened and we reveled in all its glory ! the beer selection is handpicked by very passionate , creative and humble people who have the gift of showing hospitality to their customers . the atmosphere is rustic , casual and earthy . the bartenders are educated , prompt and conversational . it's a haven of happiness for anyone who appreciates good beer !
burgatory makes a damn good veggie burger it's vegan too ! , with lots of great topping options . on tuesdays , they also feature a vegetarian vegan special , and a vegan shake ! they also seem to play some better music on tuesdays music for vegetarians the smiths , the cure . . even though this is a loud , happening place , they don't blast the music like mad mex does . also notable , is their house made shrub cocktails , though for the most part their cocktails are kinda weird , like immature , as in a teenager would love them sweet and easy drinkin' . servers are usually efficient . expect a wait for dinner , especially on weekends .
. shopping at cross iron mills works up an appetite and what can you do when you need to waste sometime before a movie and want a beer ? go to a pub , that's what ! we walked on in and sat on the lounge side apparently children are allowed on the other overall i thought that our waitress was friendly and service was good however there were a couple short comings . i was delivered the incorrect beer no big deal really , our waitress was good about it and took the other one away and got me the one i wanted . the second thing that bothered me was we got 2 starters and 2 mains all at once . where is the timing spacing ? i mean , our table was a bit small to begin . we ordered the shrimp cake sliders which were small but pretty tasty , the ale cheddar dip which i found very heavy and did not like the flavour was delivered to us warm not hot and was already separating . for mains , the better half got the stacked reuben and i ordered the beet salad , these were both pretty tasty but what you would expect for pub food . would i go back ? eh . one generic pub is usually like another , but if i want a beer and find myself at cross iron again . chances are high due to slim choices .
disappointed and not impressed . no flavor . from the pizza to the ranch dressing . not even after loading it with seasonings . staff didn't remember what was supposed to go on the alfredos alfredo . decent price for 12 in . if it actually tasted good . female cashier was friendly . blaze and other quick fix pizza places are better . definitely not flavafull .
hands down best reptile store i have shopped at . the owner is typically in the store and is very knowledgeable in his trade . i purchased the full setup for an aru green tree python . after pricing and researching for months i found predators to be priced as , if not better , than online pricing without the cost of shipping . being a small shop in comparison to a petco or petsmart his prices were better and the customer service and knowledge well surpassed anything you would expect . thanks again for the awesome experience and one hell of a badass setup . predators is as legit as it gets . also , in response to some of these poor reviews on here . stupid is as stupid does . common sense is somewhat hard to come by these days so don't blame a store for your mistakes its sad enough your pets have to suffer your insolence . side note . chihuahuas are stupid and if cost effective , would rather feed that to a snake than a bunny rabbit .
great coffee and it's great to support a local place ! there was a huge line but it moved super quickly and the baristas were cranking coffees out . can't wait to go back !
the food was delicious and the atmosphere was upbeat . just a few tables so maybe call ahead and reserve a spot . didn't get a chance to take any photos of the food but everything was delicious . ended the night with flan and the strawberry dessert and they both were amazing . it is tapas style so the portions are really small so make sure to order a lot and share !
a year ago this was my favorite buffet in vegas . perhaps i had just tried a few better places since that visit , but i felt very disappointed in the offerings this year . there were no hot crab legs , most of the mussels were closed and inedible , and the macarons were dry and stale tasting . i couldn't find much that i wanted to eat even the cheese selection was lacking . i sipped on some onion soup and ate a cold baguette and left disappointed . hopefully it was just an off night , but i won't be back to find out .
i went to porkopalis for the first and last time friday for lunch . your food is terrible ! worst bbq i have ever had . brisket tasted like dried out pot roast and the dirty bird turkey , the toast was aweful and tasted like your grill needs to be cleaned . the only thing that was good were the fried pickles and the drinks . you are better staying on the radio and selling porkopalis to someone who knows bbq and bbq sauce . farewell porkopalis . famous dave's and bobby q is 100x's better then what you call bbq .
the rio is a relatively nice place . it's comfortable , and the property is large with good amenities . pool area is good . staff is friendly . why 3 stars ? although the property is nice , there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided . management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels .
vic aka chili man works across from our food cart on tuesdays and thursdays , and i must say does have some of the best dogs i have had . super nice guy , chili and bbq sauce maker extrordinaire . like with awards and stuff . if you are uptown on those days come over to 4th and tryon and give it a try for a top quality dog and good conversation .
favorite place to go to uptown during the week . great bar staff , fun atmosphere , and one of the best patios in charlotte . this place stays true to the irish culture .
this place does standard indian fare and does it well . it was not overly salty or ridiculously greasy . besides , their non vegetarian dishes actually have more than two little pieces of meat . our beef vindaloo had a generous helping of beef . we accompanied the vindaloo with butter chicken , naan and raita . they had a mild chicken karahi that my young daughter enjoyed . the place would be a wonderful choice for business lunches since it has lovely decor and fast service . we will definitely be going back again .
literally the rudest receptionist ive ever spoken with in my life . hung up on me and everything , wow . i took my kids here a couple times and i am happy to say that i called back and cancelled my appointment and will never bring my children back to this building . terrible customer service .
unfortunately this place didn't taste as great as we heard it tasted . it reminded me of filibertos mexican food .
i definitely won't be coming to this location again . it took a good 15 minutes for the server to come and ask us what we wanted . we got our food quickly , however i got the all american melt and it was pink so i didn't eat much of it before losing my appetite . what also didn't help my appetite was the women's bathroom which smelled of horse manure . the worst thing was waiting for our check for 30 minutes after the server cleared our table . when we looked for her we found her in the back mopping the floor , so we had to ask a different server to get our check for us since our's obviously completely forgot we existed .
the best burger i've ever eaten is their steakhouse burger , with black peppercorns , creamy steak sauce , tomato confit , arugula and gruyere . i usually substitute bacon for the mushrooms . but my god , this burger is fantastic . fries are worth the calories but not a special trip .
lines were long , staff was not friendly whatsoever . the manager was not professional and i would suggest to not only use a different location but a different bank altogether .
this is probably the most worse apartment place i've ever dealt with . not only the apartment . just living there but the customer service the unsatisfaction that they have provided throughout my whole entire stay there it's just ridiculous . when i first try to get an apartment there they were just so unprofessional to the point of why am i even trying to move here . when i moved in the first day of me and packing my luggage in my packages i went into the kitchen and i observed to see 2 to 3 roaches sitting in touch on top of the sink . later on that day i went to the store and got some bug spray i started to spray the kitchen around the refrigerator and within 10 minutes there was roaches crawling out of everywhere . it was so disgusting . so i decided to contact corporate because i knew the office would handle it correctly . i asked him to let me move into another apartment building because of the roach infestation of just that whole day was just ridiculous . i moved into the next apartment over and still experience the same thing this place has a serious roach infestation problem that needs to be corrected . i think the reason why is because it's such a big complex that they cannot get the roach infestation control . if i were you i wouldn't even spend time trying to look at this place is overpriced for the value that they're giving you here and i would never ever recommend this place to anyone .
this is probably the most thoughtful and wonderful middle eastern lunch that i've ever had . the restaurant itself is a museum within a beautiful museum . huge portions of the walls and ceiling were imported and hand carved . the food and service matches the beautiful interior , for lunch , i enjoyed pakoras and falafel , and although the portions are small , the flavors are huge . the falafel was the star , a unique and light take on falafel with a small tabouli style salad and all atop a creamy but bright sauce .
the movie i wanted was list at this theater but didn't have . so i had pick a second choice . all in all theater seems fine .
i come here every single time i am in vegas to shop have yet to indulge in the services but i would in a heart beat if i was staying here . we usually walk miles from the other end of the strip to get here but it is well worth it . we first go to the gift shop on the first level to look around , then to the spa and then to the pool for a light lunch to sit in the sun . routine ! spa , gym and pool are all on the same level . staff at the spa are ok . professional , not over the top friendly . most times i go , there is a product line being phased out and i end up getting 50 off the high end goods that are meeting their trump end . i am happy to have a new home for them all in my bathroom . everything from face cream , bath soak salts , body oil , shower gels , foot soak , etc . the deal this time was on tara , last time was kerastase hair care . it would not be a trip to vegas without coming here to scoop up some sale goodies .
the beds and pillows are great . the rooms nice . coffee 3 . 50 a cup and 4 . 00 water . geez the resort fee is outrageous for wifi and fitness room what a joke . you are attack by sales people trying to give you a free gift ! i just wanted to check in after that i avoided the front area which means i gambled at other casinos the pool closed at 7 . why it's 100 degrees at midnight . the only saving grace is i got it on hotwire . i would have been upset if i had paid full price or even half price . via las vegas
it's trying to be the yard . and the yard sucks . the only saving grace is the food is not bad unlike the service , which is terrible .
judy in the loby is amazing . she is extremely personable . seriously , a killer personality . she's always smiling . she treats everyone with respect that i've seen .
i'm a big fan of bobby flay , mesa grill totally fits the personality menu a little skimpy but good to serve everyone i suppose service , one of the best i've seen in action . you have 3 people watching your every need before and after dinner . everything was served hot , fast and without hesitation go the distance to please the customer . the food was superb , cooked to perfection taste orginal , nothing like it in vegas .
update so since my review i have noticed that i can't tell who is cooking when . it is always delicious . i still go very often just order food every time now . girls there are all still great !
the pros ? the food . a good number of vegetarian vegan options that are quite tasty . the must haves are the mushroom gnocchi , the complementary tater tots , the amazing potato stack , the cornbread and the brownie sundae . the baby kale smoked mozzarella salad was mushy by the time i mixed in the dressing and apple , and the mozzarella was dry and flavorless . the cons ? the service was ridiculous . our waitress smiled maybe once . i had to ask her several times what she was putting down before she walked away what kind of butter is it ? what kind of dipping sauce is it ? what kind of ice cream comes with the brownie ? also , the kitchen refused to do a vegetarian version of the sunday dinner chef's whim , even though the menu is very vegetarian friendly and the place was maybe 1 3 full . that's lazy . finally , the parking situation is confusing . if you self park the cost is $ 30 , but valet is $ 7 . be sure to let the valet know you parked self parked there before you leave , otherwise you'll be stuck paying $ 30 . when i asked the hostess about this she said it's been a problem for a long time . a solution isn't that difficult . one sign , or a helpful hostess , will do .
first , i want to address the negative reviews from 2016 . this service was ran by another group of people and since has been taken over with a new management team . i got a visit from one of the members , johnny . he was very personable , not pushy and explained what services and equipment i could get for being a new home owner . i primarily wanted the adt system because 1 they are known all over the u . s . as the premier security monitoring service 2 keeping my family safe especially my elderly mother and 3 homeowner's discount plus proof of a robbery should it be needed . the installer arrived early which was convenient for us . he introduced himself as domingo . he was very polite and addressed me appropriately . we did a complete walk through both before , during and after the installation . the installation and setup was done in less than an hour . the system is super easy to use with the key fobs . domingo did a great job of explaining everything and answering all of my questions . i can say with confidence that i have a great service protecting my home . i know this will not stop anyone 100 of the time but it's worth having this service to give me a little more piece of mine . thank you both !
ended up here randomly on saturday night with my fiance . she had calamari and kush kush , i had lobster with pasta . the calamari was good , kush kush tasted the way it always does , and the lobster pasta was very tasty . nice classy restaurant . we sat at a table near the bar and were served by a polite older gentleman . would recommend and would go back .
absolutely love this store ! i would much rather come here than lowes or home depot the staff is knowledgeable and always friendly . i like the atmosphere in these smaller stores rather than the big chains where i just feel like i'm a number .
the worst $ 18 i spent on food ever . ordered scramble eggs , wheat toast , bacon and potato wedges . how hard is it to cook this . eggs where terrible , toast was cold , bacon was shit . the only thing that was good was the bartender . i would never eat here again .
this place used to be good . the food is below mediocre now ! the new owners changed way too much . the crab puffs are gross , the teriyaki sauce is bland . overall quality is at a 10 . don't bother going anymore .
living in the hottest place on earth can be dreadful when your ac decides to die . these guys came to the rescue . they recharged us in a jiffy . i felt comfortable with the recommendations made by derreck . he seemed honest and knowledgable . thank you for your help !
i had the shakes . the little glutton living in my belly was jonesing for some ematei udon . so i went back there with three more dining companions . i think four is the perfect number of diners at ematei more people means more little plates to sample yet it's still cozy enough to fit into one of the secluded booths . we ordered a few of my faves from the last visit but now i have new faves to add to the list aspara bacon pencil thin asparagus bundles wrapped in bacon then grilled till crisp and burn your tongue hot hotate butter large , succulent scallops sauteed in butter and soy sauce till they are creamy and dreamy so grab 3 friends and go . there . now .
looooove this place ! went here for the first time a few days ago and ordered the lamb kabob pita addicting . the wait was a little long , which was annoying because i was starving , but when i had that first bite . oh my ! worth every minute of a wait . the tsaziki sauce is served as a side so the sandwich isn't messy . the lamb is cooked exactly the way lamb should be cooked not too chewy , not burnt , not raw seasoned , soft and delicious . my co worker ordered the iskandar plate , which she raved about as well . it's located on mill avenue but it's tricky to find you have to park and then walk into a small plaza , then make your way to the back until you see it tucked in the left hand corner . go here and enjoy real mediterranean food !
we were staying at mgm grand and my hubby surprised me with a couple of sweets for my bday . this place was open 24 hours over the weekend . its located in a corner area near the elevators . he decided to pick up a mini pumpkin pie and a carrot cake . they both came in a good individual size . i thought both desserts were okay . the pumpkin pie has good taste in the fillings but not a memorable crust . the carrot cake was moist but i didn't care much for the icing and the overall taste of the cake . they do sell other stuff like pastries , donuts and cupcakes . overall , vegas has tons of other options to get better sweets from . i wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you're staying in mgm this is a close by sweets option .
i have converted from vegetarian to veganism since the time of my original review . now i love nami even more ! favourite tsoynamis pb j , banana cream pie , lemonbar when they have it ! and also the funny bunny that was around briefly in the spring . if you follow them on facebook or instagram you can be lured to come in by their yummy photos , which happens to me on a regular basis . i often meet non vegan friends here and they've all loved it as well .
highly recommended ! ron was punctual , polite and quickly remedied our leaky faucets ! a true professional and very reasonably priced ! he is also great with dogs and has a great sense of humor . our family would absolutely call him again !
i don't even remember when i was the last time i visited cne . i usually really sad when it is time for cne as it means summer is over soon . $ 6 after 5 on weekday is a pretty good deal if you just want to walk around , catch a performance and just enjoy a carnival like atmosphere on a summer night . spending a whole day and pay $ 18 is just a little too much for me and definitely not worth it . i like the new buildings they use for shopping . so much more organized and spacious . the food building still the same as i remembered . and i never really get anything to eat that because it is always hot , stuffy and crowded ! nothing really caught our interest this time again . will i be back ? maybe if the price is right and the weather is nice . but cne will be a part of everyone's memory growing up .
ok so to start , this review is for the new location in southside . i never reviewed the old location but i already miss it . i figured maybe since they were already an established restaurant there may not be too many kinks to work out and decided to go a month after opening usually i wait a bit after a restaurant opens to give a good review . our waitress was a sweetheart , and the food was pretty much the same . however in the hour or so i was there i watched multiple people leave after being told 15 20 mins and seeing empty tables just not be filled . the young girl at the front was so uninviting . not that she was mean , but just seemed annoyed the whole time . she seemed to just be moving extremely slow , like she just didn't know if she should seat someone or take a takeout order or what . she was very young so i don't want this to come off as rude , it just all seemed confused . also , i miss the comfort vibe . there was music playing sporadically but when it would shut off , the place went silent . our food came in a reasonable amount of time . my chicken was a bit tough compared to what i'm used to from them , but sides were delicious as usual . i can't abandon my carmi love , i'll just give it a while before i try again .
three stars because a bit over priced and over hyped ice cream place . i'm a huge ice cream fan or desserts in general so i know my sweets . hah i ordered the cookies n dream ice cream cone hoping for a burst of oreo cookie flavors but it was your simple basic vanilla ice cream with a few , very sparse brownie bit and oreos . there was no wow factor to this ice cream especially since it was almost 10 dollars i was hoping for more but was let down . sad .
very good . super busy for lunch like every shop on this little corner . homemade soups and chili . stop in for a quick bite . 5 stars due to excellent customer service . a beef soup i bought contained no beef . if i'd been driving i would have turned around and had my cup of deliciousness replaced with something else but i wasn't so i called and the man manager that answered took down my name and said to stop in later for a refund or to try something else . well sooner turned into later , but guess what ! they still had my name posted and i was able to try another dish plus i purchased another while there . i try to stop in whenever i'm on this side of town .
new to the neighborhood but tried this cleaners due to the yelp offer of 50 off for first times . i took in 12 items that all turned out very well . at drop off , yaritza asked if i had any special requests and was kind to answer several of my questions . one white lace dress had quite a bit of makeup on the delicate strap which they were able to get out . my black and white crochet overlay dress turned out great too this was first time having this item cleaned i was concerned if the chemicals could make the black dye bleed into the white . lo and behold it's perfectly new looking ! at pick up , i was greeted immediately my total was $ 56 and change . this gal i cannot remember her name was super sweet and customer focused as well . you guys won me as a regular ! i hope i can find another coupon in the future because it runs about $ 11 . 50 to clean 1 dress though well worth it for quality garments that you hope to treasure forever .
had an awesome time here at breakfast . its an old school diner . juke boxes at the table and everything ! we got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes , 2 eggs , 2 bacon and hash browns . it was only $ 3 . 99 ! i got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee . the heath bar shake was awesome ! they hook it up too by that they give you the shake , plus the leftovers in the metal shake container . so its like 2 shakes in one . it was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but i wasn't complaining . i love heath bars ! the service was awesome and our waiter was really nice ! cool vibe , good food and low prices make this one of the best diners i have ever been in !
penn teller are fantastic . they are extremely skilled with the illusions , but the sarcastic , straightforward humor is what really makes them my favorite . i love that they're up front about it not being magic , but then do amazing tricks that make the audience just marvel and wonder at how it was done . definitely recommend .
are you kdding me with this ? we've been here for 9 hrs already and have yet to be checked in why ? because their systems are down and everyone has to be checked in manually while i could normally be sympathetic in this situation , this has apparently been going on for three days now ! and we booked a suite with 2 beds because we have 4 people and now they want to give us a room with 1 king bed ! really ? this is customer service ? has anyone in their it department heard of redundancy ? or of testing a system before you go live with it ? or , worst case scenario , when the ish hits the fan after day 1 , pulling the upgrade down and reverting to the old system ? do they not have a disaster recovery plan ? the pacquiao fight is this weekend and there are 100 , 000 ravers in town for the country's largest edm event for the whole weekend . that's just this property , god knows what's happening at the others around the country . very displeased with the run around we've gotten and the lack of customer service . will not ever stay at this place again . ever !
after the last two visits i felt i should write this review . four and service have taken a hit . they were very busy so food took a long time . which is fine cause we are gonna get it hot right . nope . good was cold . done didn't eat hardly any of his steak . said it was cold . we sent back both order of kids mac n chz i opted for the country fried sirloin and ribs . the size of the steak was smaller and i still didn't finish it because it was cold as well . i ate the side of ribs because bbq doesn't have to be as warm to enjoy . i hope this review helps the restaurant we used to love going there and the whole family agreed to wait in line there than go somewhere else .
hands down our top ayce sushi spot . servers are very polite and helpful and provide great suggestions . this time we had ontida as our server and she was the best ! i asked her for her recommendations and she suggested a few of her favorites and one that was no longer on the menu , but went out of her way to ask the sushi chefs if they can still make it ! sushi is delicious and they even have ramen and korean bbq included in their ayce menu .
the doctors office , all the people here seem to really care and the staff is helpful too . way so many things to work out on in the gym , hard to choose , heck use them all ! einsteins begals , yumm . the building itself is huge , and clean , i like clean !
excellent quality of food , one of the best korean bbq i have been to . staff are super friendly as well !
fesenjan $ 13 . 95 i always have to try fesenjan if it's on the menu . unfortunately , it was too sweet for me here as i prefer it a bit more on the tart side . combination dip plate $ 7 . 75 for 3 we chose hummus , yogurt cucumber , and lebni . they were ok , none particularly stood out . athens fries i think we got the side order . again they were good , just not memorable .
hmong maintained sloppily dressed asian food store . as soon as you walk in there , you are greeted with the fragrant scent of concentrated piss . i never hit an asian food store or any store for that matter with such a scent . they have adequate products , but their produce section is disgusting and crowded . madison has little to choose from with asian foods , but if your in a rush the owner will tow your butt in 30 minutes according to their parking lot sign . yeah , customers too . hah ! and need something frozen or packaged . run in , just run out a little quicker .
i am a honda fan . i only buy hondas and i only take them to the dealership for servicing . until this dealership . my brakes started to squeak which is a sign that the brake pads need replaced . i brought it in and they looked at it and said they were fine . i paid almost $ 100 to have the brakes cleaned and lubricated to take care of the squeak . it didn't help but i was assured that everything was fine . less than a month later the brakes started making a weird noise . i brought it in and my car had worn through the pads and was destroying the rotors . i pointed out that i had it in less than a month ago for the brake pads and they said that it wasn't their fault that i would need to pay several hundred to fix it . instead i took it to a local shop that came highly recommended . they fixed it for less money and then recommended a cleaning and lubrication on the brakes because apparently honda had never done this part either . he even showed me how dirty and dusty the brakes were . the most upsetting part is that i had my family in the car when the brakes were going bad . they risked not just my life but the lives of the people i loved by not doing the job i paid them for . then there is the sales staff . some of them are good but most aren't . when i went in with my sister to buy a car they quoted a price $ 4 , 000 over the standard retail price . when i showed him three different websites , including the national honda site , where the price was less he said that the prices were wrong on the websites . we left and went to the bloomington dealership were the prices were magically $ 4 , 000 lower . if you value your life and that of your family i would not get your car serviced here and i would definitely buy a honda from a different dealership .
i have used her in the past and she was always my go to hmua . well we scheduled 4 days in advance and she said she would be there . everyone arrieved except katrina christine . we called her , texted her , left messages on facebook for her . she was online reading the messages but didn't bother to respond . the models were upset because they could have brought their make up to do it themselves . but they trusted katrina to be there . it was a really crappy thing for her to do . letting down the ladies who she promised to take care of . never will i hire her again !
came here because of a friend and great reviews for handmade fresh taro milk that it's good here . well i ordered a large no sugar with aloe vera gel . it tasted ok st first when got midway its all iced and watered down . wouldn't got back here the place is so small and long lines
i went in for a quote on a tattoo and alan was able to get me in the same day . he had quoted me for an hours worth of work and it ended up take a little over 2 and he still only charged me for what he had quoted me . his work is superb and i will definitely be seeing him again for some more ink in the future . the shop is great , clean , and i was frequently asked if i was comfortable or needed a break . this place is awesome and the location is perfect ! thanks alan !
this review of the hilton laval is based on my experience using a room for meetings and the restaurant for breakfast and lunch . we had two days of meetings and in somewhat typical style they setup the room for 20 people in a u shape and space was a bit cramped . in a previous occupation i use to conduct 15 training sessions a year so i'm familiar with many hotels and how they operate when you rent a room for a function meeting . for many hotels they try to put you in a smaller room and pack as many people in as possible . this room provided was a long rectangular shape and with many of our guests being big guys it was a bit cramped but not too uncomfortably ! catherine our function attendant was pleasant and was available when we needed a hand . her service provide was a 3 . 75 5 ! what makes it more important for me is to have a person who comes by 2 3 times during the day to make sure everything was okay ! the meeting room had nice large windows which provided some nice natural light ! meeting room was a big cold at times but i prefer it colder . many guests were a bit uncomfortable ! for the breaks i'd like to mention they put out what appeared to be v8 . this was not very popular as not as many people are a s healthy conscious ! onto the restaurant . we at the breakfast buffet 2 days and the lunch buffet . i would rate this a 4 5 as there was always quite a good selection of everything you could imagine . for breakfast there was even smoked salmon ! at lunch there was a good selection of salads , a few fish options and more than enough to choose from . although we have not received the bill yet i imagine it will be a bit on the higher end ! everything is an a la carte option when it comes to meetings ! i'm interested to see how much they charge for a flip chart and if they charge for wifi that we never used ! you usually need to argue with them concerning some of the charges they want to impose . we were charged $ 500 for the meeting room for 10 hours which in my mind is a bit steep , but probably comparable for other hotels in the area ! all in all not an amazing experience but not bad ! 3 . 75 5
flirtygirlfitness is our best recommendation for pole dancing especially for bachelorette parties ! they know what they're doing .
i had my reservations when the dark haired girl at the counter looked me up and down and walked away . after she charged me $ 22 for soup and a sandwich . after pointing out the discrepancy i was met with a blank look of indifference . after searching for recent lobotomy scars and finding none , i surmised that she just couldn't muster any sort of customer service etiquette . the other girl made our sandwich without so much as asking us what kind of bread we wanted . however , the food was tasty but waaay overpriced
amazing place to grab breakfast or brunch ! the waffles here are nice and fluffy and you can smell it as soon as you walk in . i went with my girlfriend and we ordered the b . benny and waffle benny and swapped one waffle each . the combination of the poached egg and the waffles works out amazingly , leaving you wanting to get seconds . next time i'm going to make sure to order waffles on the side of waffle benny's .
this was the best restaurant experience i've had in a long time . this place is operated by the driftwood restaurant group which owns many other local favourite places like 87 west at crocker park , hodges downtown , etc . mondays are 2 for $ 40 entrees plus a bottle of wine plus one appetiser . this is a great value ! no reservations are needed mondays , but other days they are required as the place gets busy with playhouse square customers our waiter said . since this is an opentable . com restaurant a reservation is always a good idea ! the decor in this place is simply stunning . you do not feel like you are in cleveland any more . while the restaurant is on euclid and there are big street level windows , turn your head in the other direction and you see brick , stone , candles , wood , and other earthen materials . low ceilings and a cave like feeling make you feel like you are just off an little alley in tuscany . the food is great as well . the portions were large . the flavour combinations were creative and great . my salmon was cooked perfectly as requested to medium well . the waiter alerted me that it is usually cooked medium and asked if that was okay with me . the happy hour menu looks like a great idea as well and runs late 1930 2130 m f in the bar . this place has been open since september and i cannot believe i did not experience it sooner . i cannot wait to go back !
awesome place ! fish and chips is delicious , and the portion is huge . mac and cheese is amazing . way too many tasty things to come only once . i'll definitely be back for a scotch pie and boxty tots .
everything is very good . i always enjoy coming here . soynami's are super delicious as well .
do you know how to tell if a place is really good ? if you leave and find yourself thinking , i really want to go there again . this wasn't te case with bachi burger . kiki burger pretty tasty , had a nice sauce that made the burger stand out . truffle fries they were okay , honestly i've tried better fries . maybe i should have gone with the oxtail chili fries the wait to sit was like 40 minutes , the wait for the food was about 20 25 i think . don't come here super hungry . it would probably be better to have a snack first because you can get really grumpy after awhile . service our waiter was pretty nice . they let us sit outside even though it seemed like the patio wasn't open . other people were seated outside too after awhile . the food was pretty good , but not spectacular . i think it's a place that people should try , but not somewhere i would visit often .
so i've had a few great experiences at the melting pot , and i do have to say i always enjoy a good fondue . this is a great special occasion date place and heads up . a little pricey . i was leaning towards a 3 star rating , but because of the exceptional service i received from the manager on duty danielle i bumped it up to a 4 star rating for my overall experience . i enjoyed that danielle came around to my table and asked how everything was and if we were on a special occasion , i replied yes since we were , and later after dessert she stopped back at our table and gave us 3 large chocolate covered strawberries to go , on the house as a congrats on your special occasion . i appreciate that ! that is grade a service . my favorite part of the melting pot is the dessert . in all honesty i enjoy going just for bread cheese and dessert . it's just the right amount of food to still feel full after leaving here . just a tip i've found out that if you do not have enough dipping vegetables , bread , or desserts and still have fondue left , you are able to ask for a few more dipping items usually free of charge . also , if you ever feel like tortilla chips with your bread veg cheese fondue , just ask and they will bring you out some . i enjoy this with the fiesta fondue .
omg , seriously worth the visit ! it's been a month since i've been there because i'm from chicago . i obviously can't stop thinking of these tacos since its been a month and wish i could have some more now . since i can't hopefully you will have one for me ! i can't wait to go back to vegas for these tacos ! i'm more excited for these tacos than the gambling or the strip !
i have a love hate relationship with this restaurant , this location . the food is consistently good and the service is consistently bad . every time i go , i swear i am never going back . they get bad remarks for service and well deserved . the management seems to think more servers are the solution . more does not equate to better . if they had 5 good interested servers and they had a section and made money , the problem would be solved . the kitchen seems well run except for the sanitation grade , 90 . the food comes out quickly and is consistent with the pictures . it takes me about 6 months to get over each visit and then with high hopes , i try again . the music sucks and it's always cold . a real restaurant manager could fix this place quickly and it would be packed .
leave it to the arts lover to finally find the performing arts center in uptown charlotte . i was hanging out in my condo trying to figure out what i may want to do while i had a few days to explore charlotte . an event popped up on my feed and sounded right up my alley so i decided to check it out . spirit square specifically the blumenthal center houses a couple of different theaters as well as an art gallery . i was here for an event in the duke energy theater and the galleries appeared to already be closed for the evening . since trips to charlotte seem to be a regular occurrence for me , i'll have to keep my eyes on this place to see what might be going on the next time i'm in town .
me and a friend went for summerlicous here . food was good ! their kabobs are awesome ! we got baklava for dessert and it was alright , nothing special . service was average . they were friendly and helpful but it was just two of them and a lot of the food took quite a while to come out and quite often we found ourselves with empty glasses of water for a while . overall , would recommend to try once , but probably won't go there again .
chorizo breakfast taco with baja sauce was delicious ! definitely enjoyed and will be back for more !
i first started seeing elena at her old spa . at that point i had only one session with her for waxing but i was so happy with my service that i stalked her to her new location . the combination of elena's personality , professionalism , quality of work and pricing i would go nowhere else . i am now trying all of her other services because i am so happy with her ! i have a facial booked for this weekend i would highly recommend felix skin care and i am a very picky consumer .
this place is all the rage and i thought it was okay . the taste isn't bad , and seems to be a good value if you are vegetarian , but if you aren't , the price seems to almost double . not financially friendly to the carnivorous .
the server was good the food was good the restaurant was so dirty in the plates needed to be thrown away they need to close this location if that's the best they can do don't eat here i'm concerned what's going to happen to me tonight for meeting here
i have no idea why pancake cafe is the 2 breakfast in madison i can think of plenty of places that have much better food and provide a much better experience . i was there with my partner today and i had the blueberry waffle which cost around $ 7 . $ 7 for one plain waffle with two tiny scoops of blueberries which were shrivled and presumably defrosted . i expected blueberries in the batter nope . i expected a tasty compote to go on top nope . just wet blueberries . and only one waffle . my partner had the 1 2 3 combo . his bacon had hardly any meat and was nearly all gummy fat . he upgraded to get pecan pancakes but what a bust we had to send back the first order because there were no pecans in the batter . when he got a true order of pecan pancakes , they were doughy and visibly not cooked through . the pecans were also very plain not toasted . my advice ? don't waste your time or your money at this sterile , unattractive restaurant with sub par food . we will never go again . we recommend marigold , lazy jane's , daisy's cafe and cupcakery , and bradbury's for excellent breakfasts . all have interesting atmospheres , better prices for what you get , quality staff our server was a teenager with her sports bra hanging out of her shirt . i shouldn't judge but it looked trashy and most importantly fresh , delicious food . if a zero star rating were an option , pancake cafe would get it from me .
yeah . theres no way to read about their extra fees if you go thorough any of the websites that 85 of people use to book a flight . but its for a funeral so i'll be paying it . so the chiseling bastards cost more than any other airline after checking a bag and getting my seat in coach , service is lousy and the amount of spam you have to get just to check in online should be illegal . stick to the major airlines .
the food here is authentic and of the highest quality . if you like bread you must try naan stuffed with cheese or garlic herbs or plain . it goes well with any dish . the only reason i deducted a star is somewhat sterile atmosphere . music is there the smells are there but it is just not enough making me forget that i am in charlotte , nc . more authenticity please ! i highly recommend this place . the best indian food on this side of the city !
solid coffee plain . food is meh .
go korean and go randy ! ask for randy as your server ! amazing service and really really good food
very disappointed with the service at this location . first it took forever to place our order , then we waited over 45 minutes to receive our food . my husband spoke to restaurant manager and he was apologetic , stating kitchen was backed up . however our food didn't come any faster . this is ridiculous , hire more people please .
plaid is the best ! he's done 4 of my piercings so far and he always takes his time to make sure i leave happy . great staff , super clean facility . i wouldn't trust anyone else for my piercings .
having tried some of the best ramen in the world during my recent visit to the birthplace of ramen japan , i can firmly say this place can keep up with the boys of japan . dare i say . the best ramen in the great tdot ? absolutely ! best in the world ? no . not quite but a worthy mention among the elites for sure . first and foremost , the broth is rich , porky and oozing with umami but maybe a little on the salty side . the chasu is tender and melt in your mouth delicious . the noodles on the other hand are a bit disappointing slightly overcooked despite my request for firmer noodles during all my visits and really lacking that distinctive chew that great ramen's have . probably because they buy their noodles from somewhere or so i heard . the egg is cooked as close to perfection as it can be but it can be better as it dawned upon me during my visit to japan . this is as good as ramen gets in town but you will have to patient . the lineups are ridiculous unless you visit during really odd times .
i don't usually rate an establishment twice but i just had the best pho meat ball and beef . i just cannot get over how delicious it is . all ingredients are fresh and you can taste the freshness . but no review is complete without saying how excellent the service is . i never want for anything and always leave feeling like a king . i started eating the lunch special on occasion . because of the amount of serving and the quality of taste , best lunch deal in az . i eat here two to five times a week . single and no desire to cook , lol . enjoy your visit and say hi to diane .
located in the arizona center , open until 10 00 every night for us later in the night owls , good service , clean and great ice cream ! nice area and one of the safer places to be downtown after dark .
tried this place on the recommendations of several food blogs . it was certainly worth the stop ! started off with the grilled shishito peppers which weren't too hot but quite flavorful . i ended up trying the miyagi san wagyu burger , which simply put was impeccable . the beef was buttery , the addons were fantastic and every bite was a myriad of taste . i imagine every burger has this taste so i'm looking forward to subsequent visits . also tried the truffle parmesan fries which were the perfect accompaniment . service was a bit slower than what i expect from a casual place but it wasn't an inconvenience . finally , this location is off the regular path which was great as there was no line on a saturday night . overall , a great experience . thanks bachi !
i could not wait for ka to end . if you're into a lot of story and less acrobat you may like this . visually , it a beautiful story but it's mostly filled with very loud play sword fighting . took my parents here for their first cirque show and wish i would have chosen differently . very disappointed .
family owned business , so you deal directly with the owners and they offer samples and some history on thier product . the kids loved it ! the popcorm is amazing especially the different combos you can make and the white chocolate peanut butter is amazing and the jalapeno is addicting , carlton you out did yourself on this one brother ! congratulations and see you soon !
celebrated my son's 7th birthday tonight at moon sushi because our previous experiences were great . service was super attentive and presentation was awesome served 6 pieces of salmon sashimi on the brim of a wine glass filled with ice . we also like going there because on birthdays , they give you a free cake . my son's cake was a tiramisu cake tonight . last birthday we went to they got a mango mousse cake which was equally good . will definitely be returning . to moon sushi your cake really helped me tonight since we just came home from a weekend of camping up north . thank you for making my son so happy . your services and efforts were definitely appreciated !
stop . i've died and got to heaven . considering that i would like my last meal on earth to include ice cream , fries , and some sort of cheese that might be a legit observation . not only was this place the most adorable shop ever they have gourmet fries and ice cream . my two favorite food groups . if i had my way , the only two food groups that should really count . went here for a yelp event and they got me hooked for life . it's a good thing this place is pretty far from me or i would be a broke and b gain 100 lbs . the ice cream quality was beyond amazing and had me reminiscent of jeni's ice cream in columbus . not to be outdone the fries were equally amazing and i think that you should try them all . it would be unfair to ask me to choose my favorite . or even just one .
reliable and knowledgeable home inspectors . i have been recommending them as part of our real estate team for all 2018 we are all pleased .
yelp told the truth , this ramen is amazing . the tonkatsu broth is maybe the best i've ever had , perfectly balanced . really nice staff and cozy atmosphere too .
california burrito . french fries in a burrito is the best innovation . quality freshness is alway hit or miss .
midici house salad . phenomenal ! i'm not usually super into presentation , but i love love love it . definitely a heavy salad , like could have by itself for a meal . the balsamic glaze and the roasted tomato dressing made me super horny . for sure a 10 10 visit courtneysalads on instagram for more salad reviews !
i'm not really sure why there's been a lot of complaints about customer service , but i've been to fry's since it opened a couple of years ago and i have not had one bad experience with customer service . maybe slightly pushy customer service , but certainly not awful . or maybe i've just been pretty darn lucky . fry's used to be known in my family and friends as the go to place for cheap electronics although now the internet seems to be catching up very quickly . it's not to say that fry's isn't cheap it certainly is at least with electronics other stuff feels like the price is a little jacked up , and it's range of products it offers is pretty impressive compared to stores like best buy . my only complaints about the store is that whenever they release their sales ads in the newspaper , it is almost guaranteed that some of the products on sale will be gone before the first day of the sale ends ! oh , and the slightly pushy salesmen who seem all too eager to help me , especially in the laptop section . seriously , all i want is to see some new laptops and play around with them a bit in peace , and i get employees who are all too happy to be all do you like that laptop . that's a pretty awesome laptop . you should get that laptop . let me know if you need help even though you may not want it . two of them even followed me in the annoying telemarker trying to sell you something sense , not the creepy stalker sense . at least i know if i ever need help finding a new laptop , the guys there seem to know their stuff .
michelle is the best therapist i have been to in charlotte . no frills at elements , in and out massage and in return they offer reasonable pricing . the staff is always very friendly and the location is easy . michelle is amazing if you enjoy deep tissue massages .
good for the most part . umar bowers is a nice guy , cares about his patients their health and well being . for this reason i would recommend him as a primary care doc . he is knowledgeable , methodical , patient , comprehensive . one of the best primary care docs i've seen . only complaint is one of the personnel that draws blood in the lab . he could have more of a customer service oriented attitude . he tends to be abrasive abrupt . overall , a fan of this practice ! would recommend it !
great service . awsome steak . loved it . i'm a professional bartender . so take it from me great . dana
excellent ! not sure if this l'express or the one in manhattan came first but they are both delightful . i was so glad to be able to get a 7 30 reservation here . the smoked salmon appetizer with capers and onions was wonderful as well as was the quail and shrimp risotto . the wait staff was extremely attentive but not overbearing which is a hard balance to hit . i was pleased to note that although they are known for their wines that they also had beers on tap . i appreciated that the menu was translated into several languages . i would love to come back here when we return to montreal
i violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to whole foods . whole foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare that would be me . yet , this store is a foodie's dream . there are aisles upon aisles of glorious , wholesome products pun intended . everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item . no joke . it took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable and economical . i roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey . strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation . did i want a made to order wrap ? or a glass of wine and a couple tapas ? the live music was alluring . maybe sushi ? pizza ? salad bar ? soup ? maybe something from the smokehouse . oooh ! a cupcake from the cupcake bar ? on and on it went . my final decision was sushi . the spicy tuna roll tasted fresh , and the pacific salad roll was very crisp . i also grabbed a container of ginger for $ 1 . 99 not the artificially preserved pink variety all natural pickled ginger . bliss . i purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side palate cleanser . all in all , a very satisfying meal . prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store . then again , it is whole foods . a word of advise come with a game plan e . g . a shopping list . if you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store , you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated .
quick stop after reds game to let the traffic thin out . all 4 of us had good beer from tap , and then added a taco to hold us over , as it was taco tuesday . they were perfect ! and vince was fantastic to all ! it's a bar atmosphere , pool table , , plenty of tvs . but very welcoming !
after being in the hospital for 3 days all i wanted was nachos . since i was staying at st rose hospital i figured i would have a friend pick up some nachos for me from nacho daddy . it was my first time ordering and since everyone always says how good the nachos were i thought i would try . i placed my order on the phone and i ordered the florentine nachos and wings . i thought i ordered boneless wings but when i got my order my nachos only had toppings on the top all the chips underneath were naked with nothing on them . my boneless wings had bones and were not tossed in sauce like i had asked . i guess u should order in the restaraunt on case u have to send your food back . will definitely not be going back even tho the little bit of nachos that had toppings on it was delicious it was such a rip off though
tldr naina's has the best burgers i've ever had the pleasure of eating . niana's kitchen is a tiny little restaurant just off of blackfoot trail kitty corner to the crossroads farmers market . you could drive by it a thousand times and never give it the time of day because it's in the little crap strip mall in an industrial area that looks half closed down . if you continue to drive by it however , you'll be missing out on something wonderful . my first visit , i got i believe the mediterranean stuffed burger . anyway , it was stuffed with bacon , goat cheese and other amazing and wonderful things . when i saw it was a stuffed burger , i figured i might get a bit of the flavor of the stuffings , however when you bite into that burger , it's bursting with flavor ! there was goat cheese in almost every bite and i was in absolute heaven . i was also really impressed with the fries . i'm perpetually bored with fries , even from places that have amazing food . the fries at naina's are seasoned wonderfully . they were cooked perfectly and a bit spicy . i actually enjoyed eating them . i found naina's about a week ago , and i've returned 3 times since . i highly recommend it .
i tried it and loved it . it's a hole in the wall place . the man that served us was very nice and checked on us multiple times to see if we needed anything . he was careful not to interrupt our conversation . i asked if he was working by himself and he said yes , it's always just him . we ordered the pad thai , red curry , and thai tea . my friend who had never had thai food before enjoyed the meal as well and said he'd love to come back . the restaurant also received a's from the health inspectors multiple times . i've never left a yelp review before , but i was just really satisfied with this place to not leave one .
wow ! the basic breakfast was amazing . i got mine without egg and they threw in extra bacon . i'm not a huge pancake person but they were light and fluffy and the syrup . the syrup . amazing ! very thin and vanilla flavored . it was almost like liquid whipped cream . the bacon was thick and well done , how i like it and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . perfect ! i'm just upset they are next to my yoga studio , i'm literally going to gain 10lbs now that i have found this place .
very relaxing place to enjoy an evening with friends . the wine is good and the atmosphere is amazing . their pizza is really good , much better than local pizza shops .
our 2014 bmw x5 diesel broke down on tropicana avenue today right before the s . las vegas blvd intersection headed eastward . we contacted our bmw road assistance which initially patched us to the service providers called commerce auto towing . their driver reached us in the appropriate time 1 hrs , but the driver did not have the tools to tow our truck instead of contacting another tow truck driver with the appropriate tools to tow a 2014 bmw x5 they simply left us behind and listed our exchange as refuse of service . in no way shape or form did we refuse service let alone were offered any service to tow our car since the tow truck was not capable to tow a vehicle from 2014 . the tow truck driver if i can remember will william simply left us in the farthest left lane of the intersection with out any remedy . no one should be left behind by the tow service although they did not have the appropriate tools . perplexed by this exchange , we called the commerce auto towing in which he said we are fully capable because we tow 2018 maseratis , your 2014 bmw is nothing new to us although their driver had no tools to tow a car for from 2014 and proceeded take a very offensive manner of response to us distraught drivers passengers who were waiting for their tow driver for approximately 1 hr and 30 mins . this company is a joke , save your time , potential well being , and money before you even consider this service provider to help you out during your time of need . no driver who is in a dire situation should feel disrespected when asking if they would send a tow truck who is capable to tow your vehicle . a very valid question . the individual we spoke with on the phone also carried on to say nobody in lv will be able to tow you since our awd 2014 bmw diesel could not shift into neutral . luckily we found a real tow company 777 towing that was able to help us out and end our terrible day in lv . i don't leave many reviews but when i encounter some flagrant treatment of customers such as this . i feel compelled to let other potential customers know that their best interest is not in mind with commerce auto towing cpcn7293 . most sincerely , vh
wife and i stopped in for lunch on wednesday . the food here is delicious and the service was excellent . we will definitely come back again . if you haven't tried nora's before i highly recommend it .
recently went to the restaurant and not only had great meal waitress , but the restaurant was extremely clean . will definitely be returning next trip to vegas
i had a driver's license that was expired . does that mean i'm not 21 anymore ? the stupid guy named jose who sounds like a french dude said i can't drink there at the pool . omg , then i left without a hassle and he chased me and my 3 friends down and called the security . don't know why . lol , he was just an underpaid guy who was upset with something that day . i don't know . whatevers . i mean , i can't imagine why they wouldn't want to sell me an $ 8 . 00 beer and profit , ya know ? haha , unbelievable . the rio is great to be honest with you , just be aware of the french accent jose at the rio's pool bar
this is a great spa very conveniently located off strip . very clean and comfortably lit with soothing music in the background . my masseur asked me whether a light or firm pressure was preferred and what part of my body to give extra attention to which was my lower back . great massage with little to no distracting talk . i was very relaxed afterwards and plan on going monthly . it's a great gift to give yourself . it's healing .
health department please inspect . 11 30 am 7 24 18 . just opened for lunch and the floor is filthy . my shoes stick to the floor while walking . the men's room smells like urine and hasn't been mopped in days . food is just okay . i wouldn't eat here again until cleanliness improved .
i am a fairly new pt 6 months since i been established and i am just very pleased with the care i have received the office manger , doctor and nurse practitioner were all so nice and made sure i was well taken care of , they go above and beyond for the patients and the wait time was not more than 5 mins i checked in and didnt even have a chance to sit down which was a great change coming from my previous pcp where i'd spend all my time in the waiting room . i would recommend everyone to jones family medicine , i just wish they saw pediatrics , i would definitely take my lil ones there !
this spot is sooooo good ! we were visiting my friend's parents and they suggested it . we ordered beef lo mein , general tso's chicken , two different types of fried rice , and shrimp with lobster sauce . everything was really fresh , hot , not greasy , and flavorful . i wish i had a chinese restaurant near my own house that was this good !
i walk in every time no appointment . i am usually seated within a couple minutes . every barber in the shop is a deft touch and quick , polite , and professional . rarely any jibber jabber pushed on you , but the barbers are all very interesting . scissors and razors are their main tools , like a real barber shop . unobtrusive , but viewable tvs with sound . comfy chairs . not fancy , not pricey , and no bloody hipsters .
i've been coming to knockout fitness for a year now and it's been the best thing i have ever done for myself ! the community here is very close and everyone is so welcoming and friendly ! i met one of my best friends there and we make sure we go everyday ! the trainers are great and there's something wonderful to be said about each one of them , however i wanted to put the spot light on corwin . i have been doing personal training w corwin for the year i've been w kof and he's be such a motivator ! corwin has helped me gain my confidence , make me feel stronger and i've lost 14 pounds ! when i don't think i can do something he always pushes me to reach my goals and proves to me i can ! corwin makes going to boxing fun and not a chore that i have to do for the day ! in class settings corwin is awesome too ! he definitely wants you to get the technique and succeed . great attitude ! very professional ! lots of passion for his career ! i definitely recommend joining knock out fitness ! great feeling of empowerment ! and of course confidence booster !
how about you play fucking rock roll at your 'rock roll' establishment ? maybe a tribute to lemmy this week ? wow . sad .
pizza ok servers dying grab my plate the second the last bite one in the mouth . the place was empty so why the big rush ? i usually tip 25 30 so u blew by rushing my meal won't be back
back again ! calamari viva las vegas roll , crunch i calamari roll and so much more . 4 of us sharing a meal after a long day . service is great .
our visit to scottsdale brought us into fountain hills to look for a home . while we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about . that's when we happened upon this place . the pizza was fantastic ! it made us want to move here even more . delicious !
delicous baked goods . delicious coffee . awesome atmosphere .
i like this location as with most locations , it get sooooo busy ! the staff is always super friendly and talkative ! i prefer to go early , like 630ish , during the weekday and by 730 on the weekends and i do not have the long lines like they are later in the day ! love dutch !
i went here initially just to change my brake fluid . out of curiosity , i asked if they could tell me why my car made the sound of a dying whale whenever i let off the brakes . so the guy tells me the problem with that is i need new brake drums . i was actually happy to finally be getting this fixed . and then i drove away . my car now shakes whenever i hit the brakes . never has it done that before . my admitted mistake was not turning right back around , but i had shit to do . so time passes , and the shaking has subsided a bit . but it was still bothering me , and i finally had a minute to take it back to have them check on it , as the man politely offered if i had any problems . the main thing i have to point out on my second and last visit to this place was the same guy's attitude , which i felt the second i walked in . before i even said a word to him , i knew that i was not going to leave happy . i explained my problem , and he took my car back and said i need new rotors . wow , now how did i know they would tell me it was something completely unrelated to the work they did before ? i must be god damn psychic . i also wondered why there was no mention of this last time . i was told everything was fine . needless to say , i said no thanks . he didn't offer me a deal , and certainly no sympathy . just your average mechanic attitude that i've dealt with many a time . nothing we can do , sucker , unless you wanna shell out more money ! i've often wondered how shops that pull this kind of shit stay in business . i now realize it must be all that money they make feeding off the gullible . right before i left , a young girl walked in . if she had been there for anything other than a smog check , i would have told her to run away .
my rating should be taken as closer to a 3 . 7 5 stars . we each ordered from the special fixed menu which is $ 36 and includes an appetizer , entree and dessert . they also provide bread with a honey butter spread which was a nice compliment to start off with . i got the caesar salad , prime rib with loaded baked potato and the creme brulee which had pumpkin spice in it , as the waiter put it for fall . my date had the chipotle marinated top sirloin with goat cheese butter with loaded baked potato . same app and dessert . they actually gave us the mashed potato by accident even though we asked for the loaded baked potato , but hey , more for us ! food was really delicious and plenitful . large portions so each of us took a bit of our food home . the steaks were seasoned really well , cooked perfectly and the cuts were really great , nice amount of fat which of course is partly what makes a great steak delicious . salad was great , lots of bacon and parm . creme brulee was good as well . i gave it 3 . 7 because comparing to the keg , the quality of the chops are better at the keg , but i would still recommend this place as an alternative . ambience is dim and the seating arrangements are private and spaced out nicely . lots of cosy booths . we also had a great waiter , name was kenny .
oh , amelie's , what do i not love about you . i only wish i lived closer . one time i drove to you at 2 30 am and spent $ 11 . i'm not saying i do this every night , but it's comforting to know i can .
huge supply of products . superb customer service . will be returning very soon !
fresh food , great salads and soup , great attitude from their staff . their catering is excellent and their food is outstanding .
great meal , looking forward to our next visit . the wife loved it . it was nice to see a local vqa wine on the menu , supporting our local economy . presentation of the food was perfect . it looked as good as it tasted . the service was also excellent . the only real negative was for a high end restaurant some of the decor was a little beat up . chipped edges on the reservation desk , scratched base boards , and chipped paint on the wall beside the wife etc . i would definitely recommend stk .
found after a bit of a drive around as i was on my first visit to calgary . the lack of external signs did not help . located in a wing of a mall , the hostess greeted me as i walked in the door . there are two sides to this restaurant and i chose the more formal side because of their a la carte food offerings . the other side was more of a noodle shop , which is great but not what i was after . a nice pot of chrysanthemum tea was brought , and you can choose any of the teas they have , while i perused the menu . there was way too many items i wanted to order , but since i was only in town for one more night , i finally , and with difficulty , ordered the sauteed shrimp and scallop with vegetables . it was very good , the shrimp were perfectly cooked . i was charged $ 2 for rice , which must be the standard practice here . a complimentary , sweet carrot soup dessert rounded out my meal . overall , a very good , reasonably priced restaurant that was easy to locate once i found it .
as an airport , i'd say this place does its job . simple layout , screens at every turn updating flight status , and overall a clean facility . i had no problems when checking in for a flight . tsa staff were extremely gentle and handled me with care , i walked out of there with no pain or discomfort . but in all seriousness , security check was your typical long delay , but its to be expected for an international airport . once i got past security , i was able to find my gate with no problem . the enterprise shuttle ran every five to ten minutes , which is very convenient when in a hurry . although i didn't use the pick up or drop off lanes , they seemed to be running smooth with no delays , my shuttle was able to get through with relative ease . simple layout , modern facility , customer service was good . overall , i wouldn't mind flying back through this airport in the future .
i ordered the side ceasar salad , fresh with a great ceasar dressing , and the margarita flatbread with chicken . the flatbread was cooked to perfection and was delicious ! a definite treat in the southpark mall food court . oh , the service was exceptional as well .
wonderful , great wait service . very attentive . very quick good flavors and they even had fidello my fav sopa . my daughter fell in love super kid friendly . will mosdef return . next time to drink at the bar lol adult time
this family owned business has been in the same location for nearly 40 years . the food is amazing , the service rocks and i love the casual feel of the place . a big plus for me is that they use real cheese , not whiz !
sumomaya has a great atmosphere and has delicious food . very friendly staff and great service . did i mention the great food ! ? my family went there for the first time and absolutely loved it . the soup was delicious and big enough to share with another person . all around a great experience

this was a last minute date night for the husband and myself as well as one of our favorite couple friends . alas this place did not disappoint . the food was fabulous ! we started with their pomme frites everyone at the table turned the cone upside down at least once to get the last of the crumbs . i had the mimosa salad and french onion soup . i consider myself a french onion soup connoisseur lulu's did not disappoint ! the one teensy downside was the service was a wee bit slow . they'd seated approximately 15 tables simultaneously . as it was the downside became an upside as we just had more time to consume some of their yummy cocktails . our waitress was very attentive checking back often to see if we needed anything . the only thing this place was missing was a view of the river seine .
being in vegas during the busy first few weeks of january , my friends and i thought about how we'd get into the playboy club and circumvent the line . my secret , eating at the connecting overpriced restaurant ! the view is spectacular , that's what i seem to remember the most . oh yea , and those espresso martinis that eventually led to me jumping into a pool fully clothed at a private party . food averagish italian food . massive portions . seriously , like every other place in veags , they dish out tons of food . probably only need to order 2 appetizers and one entree for three people . at least for 3 females . after dinner , we slipped one of the managers a twenty and were whisked right into the club , no line ! nothing quite like getting in the backdoor at the playboy club .
a great place to stop by and check out . it's free . on the lower level there are a lot of awesome cars with a lot of history behind them . upstairs is a cafe and a load of trophies . this is the first time i have seen any of those trophies up close and some are real works of art . there is a gift shop there too and everything is reasonably priced . kudos to roger penske for sharing some amazing racing history with everyone free of charge . lastly , the cars outside the museum and spectacular as well . you will see ferrari's , austin martins , bentley's , lamborghini's . and mush more !
had the 1 2 chicken dinner with rice and potatoes . the food here is very good but you have to get the hot sauce on the chicken , the mild sauce just doesn't cut it . i got there about 30 minutes before close so there wasn't a lot of selection for sides . watch out for the heavy front door .
the lady was super nice and patient while helping us . many people were coming in , but the lines weren't that bad of a wait .
for brunch , it was good but not amazing or out of this world ! the entrees were mediocre but the desserts were delicious ! i loved the hand scooped gelato mixed with whatever topping you desired . another favorite was a simple dish of fresh cut pineapple soaked in coconut milk rum , topped with toasted coconut . amazing !
great restaurant in a beautiful location . french toast , omelette , wrap , and chicken fried steak were all yummy ! staff is friendly and service was excellent . thumbs up !
i like this place a lot . very large portions of pho for $ 8 . pho comes out steaming hot and the broth is incredibly warm , hearty , and delicious . i always go with my usual which is pho with brisket only . mmm ! i've had the fried egg rolls here too which you can never go wrong with . fast service and a hearty bowl of pho . this is one of the closest pho restaurants i live by and i've only discovered it a few months ago . i usually go to pho saigon 8 which is across the street from pho little saigon . decided to venture out and try somewhere new and i've been here about 4 6 times ever since !
had such an awesome lunch ! came in and it was clean and just pleasant inside . staff were very friendly . they give you the option of complimentary regular water or sparkling water . which is a nice option . and give you some popcorn seasoned with some spices , super good . smokey and sweet . my friend an i started with the soup of the day . it was broccoli soup topped with whipped goat cheese . it was amazing . probably the best broccoli soup i've ever had . we both decided to get the sampler for lunch . this lets you pick 2 meats and 1 side . i chose the 12 hour beef brisket and baby back ribs with the sweet sauce . so good ! the brisket was tender and yum ! ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce had enough sweetness , enough smokey flavour and just the right kick . my friend got the ribs as well , and pulled pork . the pulled pork was good , but could have been a little sweeter . for the side i got the caesar salad . it's topped with in house made croutons and candied bacon . amazing ! overall awesome experience and would recommend this place to everyone ! will definitely be back !
last week was my third visit to noca . since it was a thursday , i had the wagyu pastrami sliders . they were very good . thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread . house made chips were great on the side . good service . top quality restaurant all around .
went out friday night to fionn's for some drinks and dinner , while the game was on , we waited 20 mins before we received our menus . she never took our drink order and and instead told us she would get our server , another 10 mins , still no server and no drinks . we left an went somewhere else that cares about their customers .
great service and decent tacos . this isn't the most amazing southwestern mexican i've had but it's decent and the decor is super funked out . the crispy cod tacos were good and the margarita was tasty a bit pricey for the quality
another frozen yogurt joint . they have similar setup as most places now days , serve your self , $ . 39 cents per oz . original tart and a handful of other flavors . i tried a sample of the taro flavor , it was interesting . then decided on the original tart and blueberry . the tart was not tart at all and the blueberry which wasn't sugar free and all natural was way too sweet , go figure . i did not enjoy it and i was bummed . they did have fresh fruit though they are brand new maybe things will change . i'm sure there will be people who will enjoy this yogurt but it's not one of my favorites .
how come i go into shoppers for 2 or 3 necessities and come out with 7 things ? i like this shoppers , right on the corner of lakeshore and leslie with a big parking lot , it's convenient for me to stop in if i get a ride home from work or if i'm out riding my bike . open until midnight every night , even if i work late i can still pop in . they have a nice cosmetics section , as well as the pharmacy in the back , and quite a large grocery section as well . there is also the post office and photo services . the cashiers are never too busy , at least when i've been there .
i've been to pizzeria libretto the danforth location before a few years ago and enjoyed it , but last night did not live up to the great pizza i remembered . i had the grilled eggplant pizza with basil , chili flakes , and ricotta salata . i've had eggplant on pizza before and love how it turns soft and creamy when cooked but this eggplant was tough and hard to bite into . i also wish the cheese had been cooked on the pizza rather than just shaved on top , because it fell off while eating . so i was left with an undercooked , soggy crust topped with tough eggplant and no cheese . on the plus side , the service and atmosphere were great and my boyfriend really enjoyed his salami pizza .
omg , the food here is ridiculously amazing ! i had the blue cheese crusted filet mignon and i'm hooked ! our server , hannah , was icing on the cake ! she was so friendly , patient , knew the menu well and had excellent recommendations ! thank you for a wonderful lunch experience , this is my new local favorite !
i have been here many times even though i'm not a resident of vegas . i come here to get my sushi fix whenever i'm in vegas and coming here always leaves me satisfied . i understand the frustrations of some reviewers that the buffet is a bit overpriced and i agree , but if you compare this place with all the other sushi restaurants all along the strip , it is a bargain . the best thing about this place is that it places equal emphasis on the sushi , hot food , and the dessert . my only complaint about this place is that it's hard to find if you find yourself walking the miracle mile . getting there seems like a mile walk too ! enjoy !
i attended this milestones today for lunch and even though the food was good , i experienced really mediocre and almost don't care attitude in their service . first of all the restaurant was less than half full . we were a group of 10 individuals and probably the only group that had this many people . but it took almost 30 minutes from the time we ordered and got out food . lunch times are when everyone wants to eat as fast as possible and get back to their desks but i don't think the restaurants didn't have any interest in serving as quickly as possible . 2nd of all , my friend ordered a salad and mentioned that hes allergic to nuts and to remove it from the item . a waitress not our initial waiter brought the food to all of us and placed the salad that my friend ordered in front of him with some nut like garnish on top of it . when my friend asked what it was she almost casually said that those can be pine nuts . then she almost ran away when we had to call her back at this point she seemed a bit annoyed and when we mentioned that we said no nuts , she was like your waiter should have taken care of it in an almost disregarding manner . then when we inquired our waiter about the garnish he mentioned yeah it doesn't have nuts but if you want you don't need to eat it . this is not how service should be done ! nut allergies can kill people and i cannot believe the waitress had such an attitude towards it . this is totally unacceptable . lastly , immediately after our food was placed on the table , the waiter asks us how the food tastes and i am going can you let us eat first ? i didn't mention it to him but whats up with this ? overall not a pleasant experience . probably attests to the fact of why the restaurant was less than half full while the jack astors etc right opposite seems to have a good flow of customers .
their service was good , nice ppl . the food is absolutely junk . i feel like they got a group of kindergartens kids cooking microwavable gas station food in the back and that's what they're serving . don't go there . bad waffles
if i could have one dinner to rethink , i would not have picked to come here . i only give one star because it won't let me do no stars . we had reservations , showed up 10 minutes early and we were sat 10 late . when we ordered our food we were told there weren't enough stones . so we had to wait even longer . it was definitely an experience . just one i never want to have again . the service was one of the worst instances of my dining history .
this place has good food and quick service . a must see in las vegas . and conveniently located next to everything ! if you haven't been here before you must come in today
one of the best brunch spots in the city . unique features the classic brunch staples . high quality food with fresh local ingredients . a great place to take friends and family if you want to impress ! highly recommended .
i was violently throwing up within an hour of eating ! all night long , i have never thrown up that hard ! my body was sore for 2 days afterwards ! i called the buffet to report it , they said i had to call the security office , so i did . made a report and they called me back with questions and that's it ! $ 22 and i was sick all night ! so no i won't go back ! horrible ! needless to say , they don't care !
i loved this place . the location is perfect walking distance to theaters , china town , station etc . . i also loved the indoor swimming pool i do laps every day and it was great to have this option . the breakfast was very nice as well although the dining area can get very crowded and the staff encourages you to take your food to your room if you want to . speaking about the room ours was very clean and large with a nice seating area , and nice kitchen with a full size refrigerator . the staff are very nice as well .
went here for a father's day dinner with my wife and two little ones horrible experience . we had three different servers take our drink orders . which never arrived . after waiting for 20 beer less minutes to try to order our food , we had to leave . i've had poor experiences at this location in the past , but this one took the cake . add the fact that the menu prices keep going up , chips and salsa are no longer free , and there are a growing number of better quality tex mex options in the gta there's a chipotle right next door ! , and i will not be returning here with my family .
they have the amarone wine i sooo love . wish the store was the size of the one in atlanta , and this one has most of what i like . so will be going back
ended up here after trying to go to citizen r d . we ended up sitting in the bar area on a high top . they offer a good selection of wine by the glass and had the crush cab , which was very good . not sure if the bar menu is different than the main room menu , but the selections seemed rather limited . we ended up going with the lamb burger and original chop salad . both were very good . the wait staff was attentive and friendly ,
what can i say , debi and staff fixed my wedding dress so i looked like a million bucks on my wedding day ! they are super kind and personable and understand the importance of having a wedding dress feel comfortable and look beautiful !
good eastcoast style pizza . love the eggplant topping .
backpacks are not allowed , while there is no lockers . i have to hide my backpack in the bushes outside the stadium as the staff's suggestion .
le select bistro , just the name brings back memories of foie gras on a board , cheeses , duck and all sorts of french delicacies . since we are not in france and it is sometimes hard to find a relaxed french restaurant you hold on to the ones you have and le select happens to be one of them . le select bistro far proceeds my lifetime having many distinguished chefs pass through their kitchens over time and forever securing its place as an institution for high quality cooking in toronto . because i live in la , every time i get to come home for any period of time i make sure i make it out to this pillar of gastronomy for a dinner . if you do le select , do it right . rule 1 take a cab because you will want to have wine and lots of it . their wine program is extensive and has a focus on top tier french wines which i have had the pleasure of experiencing each time i go . 2 don't go there and try to be on a diet , if you go , go all out , order the duck confite eat their homemade bread and yes eat a giant slab of their mouthwatering foie gras . lastly make sure to try some dish that puts you out of your comfort zone because the team of chefs downstairs will not disappoint . le select has been an institution for years in toronto and whenever i am lucky enough to get a reservation i feel honored to dine at such an established landmark of gastronomy . i will be back le select , you can count on that .
great place for a nice and filling salad even if you are not a salad person . slightly sad that they made their bowls smaller form last year , but still a great place for food . i usually get a build your own salad where you can select anything from their wide selection salad bar . ingredients are fresh and the salad is usually big enough for two meals . a nice healthy option , i recommend giving it a try !
just moved from california to arizona 7 months ago and it's been difficult to find a good barbershop especially one that the barbers actually listen to what you want until my curiosity brought me to senior's barbershop . i've been getting my haircut there every thursday with mariana and shes really good with skin mid fades i literallly walk out there with my head feeling like a baby's bottom derek , yolanda and mariana are all very good barbers , they take credit and cash , and always have the latest news on . check out this place , you'll love it .
5 stars for pokitrition ! best poke restaurant in arizona . the sushi wrap was amazing , basically a sushi burrito but better ! if you love fresh fish and sushi , you will love this place . i hope they add more locations , preferably the north phoenix area !
so , so , so good . just sad i didn't do my research and find them years earlier . they are truly chicago style . i ordered a couple items to try for take out . a medium thin crust pizza with italian beef as my topping , and an italian beef sandwich dipped , as we chicagoans say . which basically means as soaking wet as possible . the pizza was orgasmic . i'm a chicago native , born and raised . i moved to las vegas 12 years ago and have been searching for the perfect chicago pizza and chicago italian beef . back home in il my preferred spot was aurelio's for the pizza and portillo's for the beef . rosati's was spot on for both .
i have been to many locations in many cities of this upscale chain . this one is fine . not amazing but no huge concerns . the upper level booths by windows are always are uncomfortably drafty . i have had experience one more than one occasion with annoying hostesses that made my party wait to be seated in the lower level because it was freezing even my dad who has never complained of ever being cold complained . on one of those occasions there were all but two tables empty in entire large restaurant . but the warm carrot cake almost makes up for it
in town for a conference in vegas and looked up the best asian restaurants near the strip . gangnam popped up at the top , so here we are ! we ordered the gangnam platter and it was excellent . quality of the meat was tender and bibimbop wa also flavorful . very glad i found this place !
i have ordered delivery from china rose in the past . typically we have ordered full dish selections rather than combo dishes . very good food we thought . the food has always been fresh , very tasteful and satisfying . tonight i ordered a combo dinner for one with an extra side dish of salt and pepper squid . stale and horrible ! it tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter for 2 days . the woman that i ordered from on the phone was not helpful at all . never again
i am so glad to have a great wine and cheese shop in ahwatukee ! they have quality product , the staff knows their stuff , and the wine tastings classes are great .
what can be said about sonja without completely understating the incredible attorney that she is . for the first time in my life , i was in search of criminal defense attorney and was extremely unsatisfied with my meetings with large firms that popped up on the first pages of google . aside from the fact that they were significantly more expensive , i didn't receive an ounce of human decency from them . rather than telling me how they can specifically help me , they just kept listing off their accolades and awards , and selling me on their name . i was looking for someone to tell me how they were going to fight for me . i found that in sonja . by chance , i found her through a referral . i read her reviews , and every single one mentioned her dedication , toughness , and relentless work ethic to help her clients . within 5 minutes of talking to her , it was obvious the reviews were spot on . she responds so quickly to my texts , emails , phone calls etc that it felt like i was her only case . i couldn't have been more impressed with how she handled everything . if you're reading this and are on the fence about who you want to handle your case , just call her . you won't regret it .
don't putt putt here ! the greens are ripped up and the holes in disrepair . we made it to hole 10 when their bulls eye attraction are our balls . someone had kicked it in . how do you not inspect your greens ? what's more . they refused to give a refund and tried to give us another round . i will not go back and explained this to the manager who finally gave me my money back .
i've never left a negative comment about a business but i am so disappointed with this store ! every single time there is long wait at least 30 to 45 minutes no matter what time of day . and then to make it worse the customer service stinks ! they are absolutely flat out rude . acting as if we are in their way it shouldn't matter but just this year i have spent $ 1000 and that's just accessories . i'm not staying tonight to waste my saturday night here i guess i'm coming tomorrow morning when they open what else am i going to do with all this stuff that doesn't work
went to buy pillows . went to check out they were ringing up 11 . 99 when they are in a basket with the price of 5 . 99 manager was being a b said no they are 11 . 99 i said well remove that sing of 5 . 99 cuz that's what it has . she said those dont have a price i said well go and remove it cuz they have 5 . 99 she went seen but still said no so i left the pillows .
suggested i tint my eyebrows . so i let her tint them and i hate my eyebrows so much now that i want to cry . they are absolutely horrible .
pretty good we were in a rush , the burger was good and the fries were amazing ! nice atmosphere and the server was very friendly . definitely will return !
boardwalk beach food . i would not let the wolfgang puck name on the outside trick you into thinking you are eating anything else except pool food . i've had better food at community pool clubs . they were nice enough to make me a ceasar salad wrap since there were not many vegetarian options so that was a bonus but it was not good . it was the most overpriced for mediocre food i encountered in vegas . next time i'd head inside to canyon ranch instead .
i think this is such a great option for vegetarians or vegans ! i absolutely love the lettuce wrap bean burger ! the create your own salads are always fantastic as well ! my husband is a meat eater so when we frequent this establishment we get the best of both worlds . the have a variety of drink specials and always a special artisan burger of the month . i cannot wait till they finish building the location in weddington .
you get what you pay for . we usually stay at the venetian when we go to vegas , but the lux was too cheap to turn down . we werent expecting too much for the price . we will be heading back to the venetian next year . it all depends on what you are looking for if you will like the luxor . its cheap and it is a pretty nice hotel for the money . pretty nice pool and the housekeepers are excellent . our room was always clean and in good condition . saw several reviews about dirty carpet , ect . tender steakhouse has an excellent bar . now the downside , poor customer service everywhere from the front desk , the food court that's a whole other review just staff in general . the up charges for everything , resort fees , lounge chairs , lockers , ect , with all the upcharging and taxis , we really didn't save too much . no wifi ! really ? no bathtub in my room this was a big let down . only one good restaurant in the entire place . in a nutshell , not horrible , but not very good .
arrived around 2 am . on saturday morning . washed up and went down stairs to check things out . started to play some machines for about 20 minutes and noticed there were no cocktail waitresses . ok . so i went to the bar and ordered two drinks , belvedere sprite and bombay sapphire with tonic . it was about $ 21 . 00 . the drinks were very watered down and my girlfriend didn't even finish hers . ended up going to the little market inside the hotel and making our own drinks . buffet was very generic . not coming back .
in all my visits to las vegas , my expectation level of food can be based on the star rating of the hotel . the paris being 4 stars , my expecation level was clearly not met . its more then obvious management obviosully does not care for its visitors to the le village buffet . this past saturday was my first and last visit to the buffet . i found many items either luke warm or cold . lots of vegetable and fruit items were either rotten looking , and sour tasting . lots of entrees did not even have the lable , so you didn't know what have the items were . aside from the terrible food . you find employees lacking basic customer service skills , they cant say hello , and its obvious there miserable . i rember two couples being seated before me and my mother , even though we were ahead of line . last but not lease . i learned not to judge a book by its cover . i twice went to the flaminog hotel , which is clearly an aged building . however , i found the buffet exceptionally good for the price .
this location is set up more to be a print centre than an office supply store . however , that doesn't mean they don't have what you need . i've gone in a couple of times here with what seemed to be odd ball requests and they're always had what i needed . this is a handy location too being right next to the reference library . if you're trying to do some research at the library and have forgotten a pen or something , you can just run across the street .
fun place for a brew and bar food ! they bree their own beer and have some great small plates . i was out with a client and coworker . we got the bacon wrapped dates , smoked wings and sliders . all were great ! their ipa beer , which i had was good stuff too .
this was my second time at the baltimore house . my first experience here was awesome . good service and excellent food ! my second experience however was completely underwhelming . i'd give this a one star rating if my waiter was not doing the best he could , but he was pretty awesome considering the circumstances . it started with another server bringing dirty side plates while not even realizing they were dirty until after setting them down on the table . i received my mixed drink with flat ginger ale . it was replaced for a fresh drink , but i was charged for 2 drinks . we ordered a calamari appetizer which was a very small portion and had basically no flavor . the menu is different as they no longer serve sushi or habachi . i ordered the surf and turf and got the teriyaki chicken with a crab cake . the crab cake was horrible while the chicken was okay . they forgot half of my food , which the server was apologetic and offered to get out to me , but at that point i was just ready to go ! stopped and got some tacos from a little place down the street right after .
the wife i have eaten this location several times . their burgers are really good , have a full bodied steakhouse flavor . the iceberg lettuce salad is 1 4 head of lettuce with dressing . kinda hokey if you ask me , but other restaurants are doing the same , so i guess it's just me .
looking to hit some of my bookmarked restaurants on yelp , we decided to meet up with friends at casa corazon in phoenix on a recent visit to az . glad we made this choice . this restaurant is in a charming , converted small house with a wood beams , neat decor touches , a bar , a dining area and kitchen . we were greeted warmly and told we could sit wherever we wanted , so we picked a table kind of in the middle of the dining room . we were brought out some chips and bean dip and told there was a salsa bar in the kitchen area and to proceed there for said salsa . holy moly ! what an awesome salsa bar . i liked that it was labeled in levels of hotness so there are no surprises on the scorch . as a girl who loves her verde sauce , i proceeded to get three kinds . yum ! it was a warm summer day , so , of course , i wanted a refreshing libation . the bar menu was intriguing , but i am a margarita girl at heart and chose a mango margarita with salt . mmmmm , so good and hit the spot . perusing the menu , there were many interesting choices . i love mole and finally decided on the mole poblano . while the chicken was tender and tasty , the dark mole sauce was a bit too sweet for me . this was served with freshly made tortillas , which i picked corn . omg , these were so good . i could have just ate tortillas here with butter and salsa all day and been a happy camper . i tasted the flour ones at our table , also , and they were equally delicious . entrees come with a side of rice and grilled veggies . these were delicious and a nice accompaniment to the meals . the other items ordered at our table were unique and enjoyed by my tablemates . i had a bite of steak mexicano which was very tasty . service was kind , attentive and friendly here . staff was very nice . this restaurant is on the small side and started to fill up after we started eating . it is awesome that there is ample parking here with their own lot behind the restaurant . casa corazon is definitely filled with heart . a real gem in phoenix .
after 2 days of starving ourselves trying to find something decent to eat in vegas , this placed fed us real good food , everything we tried was so good and staff was no different , we know where to eat from now on , save the tuna and tamales were our favorite ones
i have been here a couple of times now and love the variety of food and its very filling .
i don't have long term experience with this practice , but i can already tell that dr . jeremy and the rest of the staff are very caring and want the best for every animal that comes in . my dog is usually defensive in new stressful ! situations , and they were very slow and sweet , quickly winning his affection with scratches and treats . he has been very sick and they were willing to attempt treatment without running a lot of expensive tests that wouldn't give us definitive answers . they are also quick to respond to calls and able to make emergency appointments when necessary . i will continue to take my pets to dr . jeremy and twinsburg veterinary hospital .
i only go in for the spicy beef patty , i think it's the best in the city and i never ever leave kensington without having one . i will grab one even if we just came out of a restaurant . staff is friendly , but then again my routine never takes us past hey may i please have a spicy , $ 1 . 50 or how much ever it is , thank you .
get 1 campechano or carnitas taco get 1 milanesa torta get 1 mexican soda . enjoy . be happy .
great gym , but they are horrible with canceling memberships . was on a month to month promo and just had to give notice when i wanted to cancel . informed them that i was moving and filled out the necessary paper work to cancel . they still charged my account the next month and without me knowing , sent me a refund check for the amount they charged . well guess what , i moved ! they sent the check to the old address and both urban active and the 3rd party billing company have just been blowing me off . basically have to wait for my credit card billing cycle can be over so i can dispute the charges . google urban active fitness billing and you will see nothing but complaints , ripoff reports , and articles about how bad their billing practices are .
a bite of their bp burger will take you to another world and then to the universe , and i'm not sure if you will ever come back . it's out of this world amazing . my husband and i are huge burger fans . lets just say our standards are way high for burgers . this burger might have just set a new standard . i don't know where to begin , the bread is soft , the meat is juicy , the cheese is smoldering , the beacon is crispy ! no non sense additives are necessary to this burger . it's a work of art and you can't f with art period can't wait to return again btw try the kale crunch salad also no soybeans
i stopped in for breakfast with a friend one morning . good prices and portions . service was decent . not super attentive , but didn't ignore us either . i just had eggs , bacon , toast and coffee . it was all good , and i would go back again .
cheap buffet , but doesn't have a big variety of food . the food is very good although it is very americanized . this place has been around for many years and if you're craving cheap food this is one of the best places in the area ! i do think they need to switch out the food some more , sometimes there tends to be cold food laying around or dishes that are finished and are not replaced quickly enough , specially for lunch . overall , i highly recommend this restaurant ! it won't let you down !
wow . we got a complimentary breakfast here with our reservation at the hotel . the food tasted funny , like they did not clean the grill top before cooking the food . then the waitstaff were really sub par . i had to ask for orange juice 5x before i just went up and poured it myself . same thing for my friend who wanted milk . the food was tasteless . its a good thing i didn't have to pay for any of it .
lion's den has done three jobs for me and every one has been exemplary . this company is a class act and really cares to address the problem correctly . they have gone above and beyond what a standard company would do every time . owner jody is personable and honest and a superior plumber . most recently he went out of his way to help correct a last minute problem and get my house so it could close escrow . highly recommend !
food was cold and service was very slow . the owner came to the table to greet us , we asked a question about an item on the menu and she was not able to assist . as the owner of an establishment you should know the menu by heart . received the check and was overcharged . would not recommend .
came here an hour before close . friendly folks , place was clean , smelled normal . sat at the bar . sushi chefs were really friendly and funny . tiger roll was good but not the best one i've had . fish on the nigiri sushi was the right temp and tasted clean but not that flavorful . not much to the nigiri pieces besides fish and rice . my biggest issue was with the rice . i did not taste any vinegar or sweetness , just plain white rice . the rice was the real deal breaker to me . i may try them again some time .
i hate to diss anybody but i just have to warn people about my experience . my friend referred me to bubba because he was good and would hook me up i should have known better than to try to save money on a tattoo . you get what you pay for . i have several other tattoos done by mike roper who is fantastic . bubba has no artistic ability . maybe he can draw on paper but definitely not on human flesh . i went in and i picked an image off the computer . he traced it and put it on my arm . the rest was a mess . he didn't outline at all , just started coloring on me like a 5 year old . i wasn't thrilled with the end result and the dimensions were off quite a bit . it sucks to know that you have something on your body that you don't even want people to see . over the next few days several people commented that it looked infected due to the 1 2 inch scabbing and redness . i went to my dr . who confirmed this and put me on antibiotics . it was awful . i ended up waiting 3 months on a wait list to get in with aaron coleman who owns immaculate tattoo and he's definitely worth the wait . he did the best he could to fix it $ 500 later . worth every cent lesson of the day . never get a tattoo because it's less expensive than an awesome tattoo artist . do your research and remember it's forever so go to the best . he also tattooed my daughter and it's terrible .
very cute , old fashioned ice cream shop ! different sundaes , floats , scoops , etc . order and seat yourself , the waiters bring out your ice cream and waters . i got the terminal tower with a group of friends for the experience . 10 huge scoops ! i've had the brownie sundae and turtle sundae , both very good . the sundaes are very sweet and kind of heavy , usually i'll share with a friend unless i haven't had dinner yet .
my daughter and i enjoyed the satay sampler , super soup and pad thai noodles . all delicious , great atmosphere , we were very satisfied .
my mind is at ease and i don't have to worry about any unwanted critters thanks to noosa pest management ! anytime i have ever had an issue , they are quick to provide service . their customer service is phenomenal and the integrity of the company is mission critical for them , from the president to the service technicians and everyone in between . noosa treats me like family .
my husband and i ordered online the night before because i was too lazy to cook . when he got to the restaurant , our order hadn't gone though . he had to wait an additional 20 minutes . when he got home , the food was excellent . i ordered a sirloin medium rare and it was perfect . the mixed veggies were not mushy and the baked potato was delicious . my husbands food was cooked perfect as well . the only things i will say negatively is the wait and i wish they gave us more toppings for our potatoes .
this is a must visit for japanese food lovers who find themselves in vegas . i never would have imagined that japanese food this authentic and good could be found in the middle of the nevada desert . every visit to vegas i look forward to venturing off the strip for a raku fix . i live in ny city surrounded by good sushi and travel to japan at least twice a year . even so , i find the quality and diversity i find few japanese restaurants even serve chawanmushi but raku has it and it's wonderful of the food absolutely top notch and as good as i've had anywhere . the neighborhood is a bit edgy relative to the finely polished strip , but that adds to the charm and fun in my view . highly recommend .
this pet hospital is very good . not sure why people posted negative comments about this banfield . their employees have been nothing but respectful and professional . i really like bringing my little yorky here !
when i was living in vegas , max and his team were honest , on time and followed through . he assessed the shower issue , got supplies and fixed it without over charging me . he also came in an emergency situation with leak in the ceiling , he confirmed it was not a pipe issue and that it was an ac problem . he didn't charge me for the assessment . he was kind , honest and trustworthy . i would definitely recommend him and use oasis plumbing again .
this is the fatbuger located inside santa fe station . one of the floor manager told me to never eat here because she got food poisoning once . you know why people get food poisoning here ? because this place is a motherf cking outhouse that serves actual sh ! t on a bun . they say that this place is open 24 hours . but , that's some bullsh ! t . every time i come here after 3 am , the crackhead midget they hired always tells me we be closed aight ! in a very angry tone . all the lights and even the open sign is still on but this loser just refuses to work . last time i came here , the guy was once again at the register . finally , this time he didn't tell me that fatburger was closed . he then incoherently and almost inaudibly asks me mey i be teken ur ordur ? i then tell him what i want and immediately notice that he is having a lot of difficulty typing in the order . he then starts inaudibly mumbling he wans a cheezbruger . eventually he begins to obviously look frustrated that he can't figure out how to use the cash register and get my order put into the computer . after about a minute , he quickly looks up at me and says we be closed ! in that angry tone of voice again . i then ask him why he originally was taking my order and he replies i wuz jus playin . omfg ! this idiot has been just saying he was closed because he was too stupid to figure out how to use the cash register . i wonder what management will do when they find out he has been doing this ? do you see the sh ! t i have to deal with when in nw las vegas ?
small little establishment but dam their pork fried rice was awesome for the price wow !
i actually went to this restaurant because of the yelp reviews . the reviews were so correct . the people were so friendly and the food was delicious . i am so glad i found a really good resturant that is close to my job . i have shared the menu with all of my co workers because they said my food was smelling wonderful throughout the office .
my boyfriend and i stopped in to have an appetizer and a glass of wine prior to going to our favorite saturday night wine tasting at the olde wine cellar . upon entering , the hostess greeted us and asked if we had a reservation . after sharing our plan with her , she proceeded to share that they were down one person and could not serve us at the bar but could offer us a table . we happily accepted the offer , however , as soon as george the owner came around the corner and the hostess asked if this was ok , he began to argue with her loudly in french . no translator was needed he was livid about us being there as walk ins . mind you , it was 5 00 pm and only 5 tables taken . even if they were booked , his behavior was unbelievably rude and unprofessional . people just a half hour before warned us of his conduct . we were made to feel so uncomfortable just walked out . we will never even attempt to dine there again and will happily take our money elsewhere .
terrible ! what started off as a $ 39 per day rental for 2 days , ended up being $ 300 . this company is horrible and has the worst customer service . they billed me even without telling me , just charging it to my card and not telling me of the extra charges . i noticed and had to call to figure out what happened . dont use them !
went in here to try my very first acai bowl ! there was no one in line around 5pm but a few people that seemed like they were waiting for their orders in the store . the staff was incredibly friendly when i ordered ! i waited there about 10 minutes for my bowl that was delicious ! i would definitely come here again , but it wish it was a bit quicker !
i like it ! i came here to pick up lunch on the recommendation of a colleague and it didn't disappoint . the lunch menu is limited insofar that you pretty much come to get the lunch special . today was garlic chicken with a side of rice and it was the perfect portion . what was best though was how fresh the vegetables were . unlike tin tin that is downstairs . these vegetables still had life in 'em . the broccoli was hard to stab with my plastic fork , the mushrooms kept their shape , and the peppers crunched in my mouth . at $ 5 . 40 total for the lunch special , i cannot complain much . i'll probably be making this a regular spot of mine . bit of advice for store owners , i'd cut down on all the bags , napkins , papers , menus , forks , sauces that come with the lunch special . those are gonna cost ya in the long run . dmo out ! downgraded rating after my second posting
hands down the nicest hotel on the strip . omg it's so nice . that's all i can say . they have gondoliers like venice and the sky is breathtaking inside . yea , it's all inside . your life will never be the same after staying here . the only reason i'd consider giving it 4 stars is because it's too nice and now i dont want to stay anywhere else .
the club is great ! most of the time to staff is nice , and i love the class variations . my favorite part is the ladies gym .
by far , one of the best manicure pedicure experiences . debbie is a gem , she is friendly and takes pride in her work . she gives great suggestions and on trend with colors style . she uses high quality product and hygenic ! debbie you are awesome !
we stayed near the airport in phoenix on a trip to spring training in march , and this restaurant farm was nearby . there are three different eateries on the farm premises , from a counter that sells sandwiches baked goods the scones are so good . i got some to go and munched on them all weekend long to the morning glory cafe , where we sat outside and had a fresh , delicious brunch . the berry yogurt granola and the breakfast burrito were perfect . there's another , fancier indoors sit down restaurant , quiessence , too . we walked around the farm grounds afterwards and observed folks at work they were very friendly and explained what they were doing and what they were growing . minus one star primarily b c i've only been here once parking signage was a little confusing , too , and our pleasant walk was somewhat interrupted by drivers that zipped up the main road possibly others who were confused about parking ? leaving clouds of dust in front of us to walk through . but little matter !
my favorite las vegas breakfast place . i've lived here for almost 20 years and have tried them all . non compare . my favorite is their eggs benedict .
nuggets weren't great and the fries weren't either . wait time was longer than usual . the 2 cheeseburger deal is a little more than before at $ 3 . 49 , still a good value . 10 piece $ 1 . 49 as usual .
i was looking to establish myself with a regular barber as i usually leave the chain providers unhappy and dissatisfied . stumbled across this business while using yelp to find a barber . because it was close by , i figured i would check it out . this business is new even though it is obvious she is experienced and well established as a barber . bottom line . this gal is amazing ! she's professional , friendly , not over bearing , and good at men's haircuts . even more , she listens and takes time to make sure she understands your needs and will meet them . the proof ? my wife said it's the best haircut i've had in years ! awesome ! fyi , when i went , she didn't have a sign outside of the little business plaza advertising her place . when you first go in off the main street entrance it may feel like your in the wrong place very salon feeling visually . don't worry , she's on the left side , first door . i'm super happy to know i have a regular barber again , and for most guys looking to just get a good men's haircut , i think most other guys who give her a try would feel the same way . oh yeah . cost . it's no more expensive than the ridiculous chains , but you get way better service with a quality haircut !
very disappointed in this location . i much rather drive to the stephanie location way better everything ! first i was confused because there was a sign that said wait to be seated so i was standing there like an idiot for 5 min and the workers were just passing by me not giving a crap so i just sat myself down i was pissed because the sign said to wait yet no one even comes to seat you . then the only reason why i came was to get some cornbread , tomato soup , chicken noodle , and brownie bites and sadly this location had none . so i was already annoyed and the bowl racks were empty so quick so you have to wait then the mac and cheese taste so watered down , doesn't taste very cheesy . the spaghetti here as well the sauce tasted watered down . not to mention they barely had a variety here . so disappointed ! this place is only good if you're coming to eat a salad the rest is yuckkkkkkk . save yourself and go to the stephanie henderson location . much better and less aged . this place needs to be remodeled .
the location was desirable but the outside and inside of the restaurant are very modern and nice . the food was awesome and very affordable ! we had the fried rice and the beef soup bowl . so good i demolished it
local tavern is a great place to get food or drinks or both . they have a very wide selection of draft beers , including seasonal beers , that are pretty fairly priced . there's also 3 bars to get drinks from , as the place is huge . it's kind of confusing , but has a very nice atmosphere . i've tried the wine country chicken sandwich , and it was pretty good . the goat cheese was great on a sandwich , but the red wine reduction was a bit sweet for me . i love local tav's side salads . they're full of greens , not just iceberg lettuce , and the balsamic vinaigrette is great . i've also tried their macaroni and cheese , which is huge , but could have more flavor to it . the tomato bisque soup is incredible , though , and i'm definitely ordering it next time .
came here with a friend to enjoy some delicious thai food as i was craving it . heard lots of great reviews about this place so decided to come here and give it a try . we both ordered different dishes and they were both amazing ! my friend ordered the khao soi and i ordered the green curry with chicken . loved the green curry you can taste the nice coconut taste in the curry which was nice and rich ! the food came out very quickly and was quite impressed about that as we were pretty hungry . customer service was great and attentive . the staff kept coming back to check on us and refilled our waters . we both ordered some beer and the thai iced tea definitely the bomb and a must when you go to a thai restaurant . absolutely delicious ! overall , we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal . great food all around . will definitely come back again !
went there last night . on notre dame but west of de courcelles in an area without many new restaurants for now , which makes it quite easy to park . decor and vibe very cool . food was excellent , had the kale salad simple but really really good , margherita pizza which was great think bottega but a bit thinner , pastas were very solid and tasty medium in size . also had the dorado which was very tasty but would have been nicer if deboned and served by the wait staff . service was friendly and efficient . the only negative and the reason for not giving it 5 stars was the music , quite loud and i don't mind loud but didn't love the playlist . some sort of techno disco funk type music . check this place out .
this place is usually packed and today was no exception . luckily , the wait was only 5 10 minutes today . they also had a deal today where if you buy a $ 50 gift card , you receive a $ 10 coupon or free app in the new year . decided to buy a gift card since i knew my foodie partner and i were going to go over that . food 2 . 5 5 got the ultimate feast today lobster tail , garlic shrimp , fried shrimp , king crab , and rice . the lobster and crab were nice and sweet , however , the shrimps were extremely salty and the rice was really dry . the butter on the side did not help with that $ 31 . 99 my foodie partner got the salmon and lobster tail . they said it tasted alright one plus side is that you can substitute the shrimp for scallops at no additional cost $ 29 . 99 service 3 . 5 5 the lady that serviced us was polite she kept refilling our drinks voluntarily which was great . however , she kept forgetting to bring us certain things such as the bill .
saw this show for my bday vegas trip 1 20 18 . it was fantastic , i highly recommend it to anyone who likes cirque du soleil style shows . the show is water themed but there or other parts that are totally dry . the music , dancing and singing are great . it's a small venue so every seat is a good seat , so dont feel like u need to pay alot for a ticket . of course there's a bar inside , drinks were nice and strong . i would definately see it again .
bad experience , awful service u can see all ice face no hello , no smile . seriously ? ! ask for napkins n sauce , however , there is no any napkins or sauce in the bag . how can i eat those mcnuggets ?
so i buy a livingsocial deal it was for a lg pizza wings and 2 draft beers why not check this place out we go there on a friday night around 630 7 o'clock prime dining area prime time and no one's in this place we walk in there to blaring punk rock music we sit down long haired punk rocker server bartender guy brings us some water and i said hey i have a livingsocial deal for pizza wings and two beers he's like what's the livingsocial ? i was like it's this deal you guys have going on you know groupon livingsocial i showed him my phone and he's like yeah we don't except that he's like i think it's fake mind you it says how many people have used this deal and left reviews for it so he's like let me go call the manager he calls the manager manager tells him he'll come there in 20 minutes i said forget it i'm out of here i'm not going to wait for the manager to use this coupon you guys put out there . what a joke . server punk rocker dude was completely condescending and unapologetic about it .
everything you need for a fun day weekend with the family . so much to do . very clean , even the bathrooms . ill be coming here for years to come !
i haven't tried the food , yet . but i'm so excited about the prickly pear margarita $ 12 . 99 i had to come shout from the rooftops how happy i am to have a taste of san antonio right here at home . i couldn't get enough of these on the riverwalk . i've missed them terribly and these at la gloria are the real deal .
we stayed here for 8 nights during cinemacon . after reading all the reviews i was nervous to stay here . honestly . we had a wonderful experience . we stayed in the forum tower the first 5 nights in an executive suite . since we were working for joblo . com we relied heavily on internet speed to get out content online . the internet was super spotty in our room which posed a bit of problem for work . we managed by using the assigned press room . the entire event was catered by properties on site and everything was excellent . we stayed an extra 2 days and had to switch rooms no big deal . we went to check into out new room and people were still sleeping in it . the front desk was super great about making up for it and upgraded us to a suite in the palace tower . no complaints at all in our new room . nothing was damaged or dirty as others mentioned . the elevators get breaking in forum tower during our conference which was frustrating waiting on 2 during peak times . the pool was wonderful tip get beers in the sundry shop next to the pool to save cash . the bacchanal buffet was truly awesome ! i checked in and then went and got ready and came back and still had to wait for 90 minutes . i bought beer from the sunset shop to wait in line .
wow ! such a great experience ! i have only had my brows professionally done maybe twice in my life . probably because i didnt know of anyone who did an outstanding job or always walked away not too thrilled with results . i have had problems getting my brows looking how i wanted them to for years . i made an appointment with heather and am sooooo glad i took the plunge . she truly knows what she is doing . my brows look better than they ever have . she really takes her time and pays attention to what she is doing . i asked for advice on filling them in too with a little pencil and she showed me exactly what to do . thank you heather !
ok . this poor rating is for a reservation we tried to make over several days then once it went through . i cancelled it out of anger and the total lack of customer service . their computer system has been down , broke , being upgraded and a 100 other excuses to prevent me from either making a reservation or checking in . their system has been down since monday this is thursday . it is still not running 100 . but you got the same stoooooooooooopid answer response . call back in a few hours . hey idiot managers ! every heard of pencil and paper ? like the old days . write down the persons name , address , bank card number . allow them to check the hell in ! i have to say all this cuz i truly believe the management here is that clueless . by weds , they must have had either an empty hotel or 1000 total insane and irate customers , that surprise ! . they started to take names and dates ! how totally clueless ! the owners need to clean house with all brain dead front desk sups and managers . heading to a different casino
the food was amazing as usual but we had something strange happen at the bar . one of the waiters came up with an apple martini and told the bartender that the customer said it was too strong and needed more apple pucker . he then took a sip from the martini glass and the bartender added the pucker to the same glass and he brought it back to the customer ! yuck !
from outside , it's just any ordinary gas station . it's en route to work so i stopped by to fill up my car . basically , i didn't travel from afar to go to this exact location . the price of gas is pretty much the same everywhere in toronto so i wasn't wowed or ticked off with how much my total was . inside there is a convenience store along with a coffee shop and an a w . the staff are quite friendly and very professional . i go to another gas station where the uniforms must be purchased at thug co . and gabbing on your phone while serving a customer is acceptable behavior . the employees at this petro canada take pride in their place of work and it is extremely clean ! i used their washroom before going to work and noticed how clean it was . petro canada wont become my new hangout , but i was impressed this morning , which enticed me to write this review . if you're in the area , fill up your gas here and grab a coffee or burger too .
beer is good that's about it . very plain menu . so many better places to eat around it i would think you'd want to step up your menu .
bell auto upholstery far exceeded my expectations when they reupholstered the headliner in my 2006 silverado hd crew cab . their pricing was very fair and they followed through with everything they said they would do . the staff is friendly and helpful . i would recommend their work to anyone and hope to do business with them again .
great spot , great people watching and amazing for vegans . this place is nestled right in the centre of the hustle bustle of lebo . an upscale neighbourhood that has a lot of walkable districts and the one piccadilly is located in , in particular actually has two competitors across the street . what's the best part ? well , there are usually at least 2 vegan options for soft serve and there are a tonne of fresh fruit toppings . while i wish that there were more vegan toppings this actually helps keep the calorie count down . love that it's all organic and the staff is supper friendly . the only thing i can complain about is that the self serve buffet topping area is made super messy by young kids and i wish that there wasn't cross contamination due to that . when the dairy mixes in with the fruit etc . it's kind of annoying rude . but all in all , as a vegan option for pgh , i love it .
i know , i know , hate on the chain boooooo . but for what it is , i had a delightful afternoon old people dinner time of 4 45 pm with my folks , with decent food and a tremendously sweet attentive server who took my dad's playful harassment with a smile . it's not the best anything that i have ever eaten , but my order of a 10 oz prime rib $ 15 with two sides was a solid meal , perfectly cooked , that hit the spot . as with most steak places , the house salad one of my two sides was served in a chilled bowl with fresh ingredients . the bleu cheese dressing was delicious . the prime rib was a medium temp as ordered , served with a tasty au jus , with not a ton of fat on it . well flavored . the sweet potato side was huge , fluffy on the inside , served with butter , brown sugar and cinnamon . and the rolls , ohhhh the rolls . with or without the cinnamon sugar butter , they are delicious . our drinks were kept filled and our server , haley , was amazing . cute as a button and just as friendly and good natured as she could be . my dad playfully aggravates the shit out of waitresses and she was adorable , took everything with a smile and made sure everything we had was as perfect as could be . we breezed in early with no wait at all , but as we were leaving around 6 00 pm , the friday night crowd was rolling in and a wait had started . great meal and i would gladly drive my folks over here any time they want so they can buy me dinner .
i'm a season ticket holder for wranglers games . i love hockey and the wranglers provide plenty of entertainment for a very reasonable ticket price . the orleans arena is a nice venue and even the cheapest tickets would provide decent seats . a fun event for the entire family .
the sandwiches are very good , but for whatever reason this location allways screws up my order ! they forget to put it in or forget to call my name and it takes 25 min to get my food . that being said the encore is very good , just be prepared to wait a while
i can't describe how amazing this is . ribs and pork and mac and cheese . nothing else to say .
this was the first time that i had visited karen thai cuisine since i don't live in that area . for this reason , i cannot make comparisons to any other thai restaurants in that area . i only tried one dish panang beef curry , which came with a perfect amount of rice to accompany the amount of curry that was served . the serving size was good for the price , the restaurant service was fast and friendly , and the food tasted quite good . they also offered thai iced tea which was prepared quite well and tasted good . i know a lot of people that own authentic thai restaurants in different parts of phoenix and the east valley . if you are looking to find thai food near northern and 35th avenue , i recommend checking out karen thai cuisine if you are in the area .
i've frequented the lazy dog summerlin location not necessarily for myself but to spoil my dog and who doesn't love their dog ? atmosphere i've only sat outside , as this is where your to be seated with your dog . i actually really like the outdoor area , there's a nice fire pit in the middle and tvs mounted as well . plenty of tables , the wait is never too bad . nice place to have brunch with your family . food one word . mediocre . i've tasted too many things here and while i can appreciate that lazy dog is trying offer a menu full of variety and it lacks flavor . tried the nachos , plain , bland , and not enough toppings . tried the oven baked pancake , someone should tell whoever came up with this idea a pancake shouldn't be baked , it sticks to the pan they bring it in and is flat . the one decent dish here i would suggest would be the fish and chips , nothing special but the fish is always cooked just right . also definitely try non alcoholic drink creations here i really appreciate that part of their menu . love the pineapple coconut water drink , perfect for the vegas heat . customer service hit and miss , i've had awesome waitors and oblivious ones . it does getbusy here on weekends and they seem overwhelmed at times . i don't like to bash people because we never know what's going on behind the scenes . i love that it's pet friendly , my dog has never gotten sick from the food and that's why i return . overall , if your looking for a casual day out with your pet and family i'd recommend this spot . if your not with your pet and looking for a nice dish , there's better options in downtown summerlin .
can't beat a place like this . mom and pop joint that has great service and awesome food . we stopped in on mother's day and got there right when they opened . got a table right away and enjoyed ourselves a bunch . stop by and check this great mexican food place out . thank you
the only reason i give two stars is because of the convenient location and the ample parking . sure , once in a blue moon you run into a postal worker who is friendly and service minded , but unfortunately the opposite seems to be the norm . there is simply no incentive carrot or whip to be effective and satisfy your customers . there are very few things maybe nothing that a government agency can do better than the private sector .
good pizza and a very friendly proprietor . the free retro arcade games help pass the time if you have to wait . i will eat there again .
3 stars remain . after not going back to original breakfast house for a few years , we decided to give it another go on a sunday morning recently . it was packed so there was a wait , but not too long . we were seated and greeted promptly . overall the service was much better this time . i ordered scrambled eggs , bacon , fruit and a biscuit . my husband got the big gooey scramble mess that's actually the name with pancakes . the food came out really fast . my breakfast was just okay . the eggs and bacon were fine but the biscuit was kind of plastic tasting . maybe it was too much bisquick or something . the taste was way off . the scramble mess was better . and it was huge . the two of us could have easily split that and still had leftovers . the pancakes were good too . better than last time . until i got to the raw part in the middle ! i get that they are moving fast in the kitchen , but make sure the food is cooked ! strike two on the pancakes at this place ! maybe third time is the charm ? after two experiences that were mixed i don't know how soon we'll go back . if ever .
look no further , lynn is who you want doing your nails i promise ! after a friend referred her to me i texted her she followed up with me in a timely manner accommodated me into her schedule today , i was so excited . i go to med school cant have crazy nails so i told her what i wanted she went right for it making sure everything she was doing was of my liking , anyone else i went to seemed to be really annoyed with my requests of having really short acrylics but lynn was so sweet took care of me . i love my nails she is so welcoming . i will definitely be back with lynn will make the drive because she's totally worth it ! 100 recommend to anyone .
we enjoyed our afternoon at j henry sons ! there was a group of 12 of us . we had called to reserve a tasting and tour . jamie was very excited to share all of her knowledge and stories about bourbon and wisconsin . i don't love bourbon , only a couple of us did , but we still enjoyed the cocktails and some tasting . you got a cocktail , plus three little tasting portions included . the farm is beautiful . the staff was very friendly . and it was a nice day doing something different . i would have preferred getting the cocktail sooner in the explanation to enjoy while we were learning about the farm . but it was a great day and if i ever needed a place for a special event , i would definitely look here .
jaclyn is the one ! give it a try , awesome area too . beautiful salon ! everyone there is very friendly and there is so many things to go see around the entire area !
my son has been coming here for 3 years now and everyone is always very nice here and treats him great . he always leaves happy and with a smile on his face . when it comes to teeth cleaning and procedures they always do a wonderful job and make sure my son is comfortable . we will definitely keep coming here for years to come .
for a fast food chain , they know what they're doing with those thin meats and cute square burgers . they are open 24 7 and everything i had was fresh and delicious . please open one in cali !
this place is great . been going here for years . richard and his crew are great . service with a smile . indoor and outdoor seating . was featured on the food network's diners , drive ins and dives .
i accidentally left my $ 400 bose headphones in the room . about an hour after i had checked out of the hotel i remembered that i left them in my room i had already bloarded an airplane i called the hotel to be told to fill out a missing item on charger back and someone would contact be right away . i did this immediately and have yet to receive a response . i have called and left countless messages with housekeeping only for no one to return my call . i can only assume my headphones have been found , but claimed by a staff member .
i love this place , rick the new owner is very accomodating . my friend from england always has to visit samosa when she is here , her fav dish is chicken korma , mine is veggie kofta with mahkni sauce . they have great lunch specials too !
i ve tried numerous of matcha ice cream place around the gta , and found the matcha here less bitter than other competitor . it has the matcha flavour and also the dairy flavour you look for in a soft serve . don't miss out on the sesame , as it is the best i found in town
really really good restaurant . i had the arugula salad with crispy quinoa dungeneous crab salad and roasted lamb ribs . the salad was one of the best i have ever had , goat cheese , beets , mandarin oranges , arugula , crab with a avocado lime dressing . delicious ! they served us bread that was baked with onions and green onions in it with a hummus dip . my friend had a red snapper fish , cooked to perfection with corn salsa . we had just the right amount of food for the both of us ! really tasty and will definitely go back for that salad !
i have ordered from this restaurant 3 times for delivery through grub hub and not once have i been disappointed . the food taste great and so is the price . their delivery service is fast . i live in a gated community off of the 51 and not once have i gotten a call from the driver asking for directions i just get a knock and a friendly go go china . i highly recommend this place .
it was loud there but since it is open inside aria , you can still talk the food was outstanding . i had the mushroom soup and the mushroom risotto and then both were perfectly made and spice so good our waiter was exceptional . great service but didn't over serve us the only thing were the prices . for vegas it wasn't bad but for what i got the value wasn't so hot overall would try it
great food and great customer service . i would definitely come back . only thing i would recommend is advertising and making stacys pampered pig sign bigger so they can see it from the street . you can only see bbq . own that sign ! now i know where it is i'll be back for more of that southern goodness !
a friend introduced me to this location almost a year ago . i have been to other friendly thai locations but this one is the best ! i mainly get the coconut chicken soup , coconut rice , and the spring rolls . the food is always fresh , piping hot and tasty . i like to put some of my coconut rice into the soup . i have also had their pad thai with chicken there which is really yummy . the one thing that i find really interesting about this location is the their coconut chicken soup is the best out of the 3 locations i have been to . i have asked the other locations and this location and they say they should all be making it the same way . i find it's not too spicy , i like the mushrooms they use and the chicken is not rubbery from being boiled too long . i was there around lunch time so it was a bit busier but i found the service to be prompt as usual . the servers are always polite and chatty if there is the opportunity to chat . the restaurant is trendy with its clean lines in design . as well it is hygienically clean both in the restaurant and downstairs in the bathroom .
love , love , love the foundry . the classes they offer are awesome , and the teachers are so knowledgeable , nice and encouraging .
highly recommend using homeowner's financial group for all your mortgage needs . we recently bought our first home and we had no idea where to begin . we were recommended to eric murietta by our realtors and he has been super easy to communicate with during the process . he and his team streamlined everything for us and educated us on the best decisions to be made . they definitely had us in mind the whole time and got us the best interest rates at the most affordable cost . we were very pleased with their professionalism and personable attitudes as well . eric was willing to help us out even outside of normal business hours which meant a lot to us ! thanks again to everyone over at homeowner's financial group ! jamie and christina
how this restaurant positively differentiates itself from all the other chinese restaurants in town 1 . the only authentic chinese restaurant that i've experienced amazing service , which is very surprising since that's hard to come by for authentic asian restaurants . 2 . very clean ! clean dining room , clean restrooms , clean everything etc etc etc 3 . solid dishes . some of their stand out dishes that you must try string beans with xo sauce dried bean curd with shredded pork fried fish fillet w cream of corn the thing is , i wouldn't go to this place regularly because of the prices . they are about $ 4 $ 5 higher and with so many chinese restaurants to choose from , ehhhhhhhh .
i was a little dissatisfied this time around . i was told that if i did the buffing it would remove all scratches and they would include the vip wash and clean my mats too . i was also told the pin striping gunk would be removed from my driver side . well none of that was done the buffing did help but was expecting to not see any scratches . i didn't say anything while i was there because i was there for an hour and a half with my impatient 3 year old and they were about to close .
great show and priced well . sat in the front row for reasonable amount . the illusions are unbelievable and he is a great showman with plenty of entertaining dialogue with the crowd and smaller illusions to fill in time while his crew sets up the large illusions .
this has been my favorite mexican restaurant for decades ! the food is all made from scratch , from grandma's old family recipes , and the food is sublimely good . los compadres food is a great example of arizona style sonoran mexican food . this is a family owned , friendly restaurant , not a big chain restaurant , where employees often could care less about the food and the service . this family cares about the food quality and making your visit enjoyable . some of my favorites are the three way burro , which has red chili , green chili and beans with cheese . i also love their chicken and beef tacos , which have delicious seasoned meat that is succulent and easy to eat , not the tough stringy dry meat that some mexican restaurants put in their tacos . on the lighter side , i will get one of their salads , like a taco salad or chicken salad which are really tasty and fresh . this place is highly recommended .
i got a body bliss at spa west , it was great . there is a very good selection of services and the environment is warm and tranquil .
when we first entered celili's we were ignored for over ten minutes before we decided to switch to a different section . once we moved into amber's section she was a great server and the food was amazing ! i highly suggest that if you enjoy a good bangers and champ mash this is the best i've found in the city ! while i had a great time and enjoyed great food i will definitely ask to be seated in amber's section next time i go to ensure i get great service as well .
the good the good thing about this theater is the stadium seating . that is , the seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them , so everyone has unobstructed views of the screen . although most theaters are going to this style of seating , not all harkins theaters have done so . even though there is a theater closer to me shea 14 , i don't mind driving the extra few miles to get to north valley just for the comfort of their stadium seating . i especially love getting there early enough to score their front row of their balcony seats . these seats offer the added benefit of being able to put your feet up on the front row metal bars . the chairs rock back a little too . the combination of a completely unobstructed view , slightly reclining seats , and being able to put my feet up make it a pretty awesome way to watch a movie on the big screen . the bad there's something seriously wrong with the concession stand here . i'm not just referring to the outrageous cost of food and beverage . heaven knows , all theaters have that in common . it seems to me that the employees at this particular concession stand are especially inept . they are slow , they are inefficient , and they are often clueless . i recently gave the employee my empty harkins 2011 refillable value cup and asked for a diet coke . he stared at me blankly and asked , did you want the diet coke in the cup ? additionally , it seems that the lines take longer than other harkins theaters i've visited . and it's consistently so , almost to the point of being painful . i'm not talking about a couple of times it's been bad on at least ten visits . almost to the point where i either don't buy any concessions because i become too impatient or i just smuggle in my own drinks and treats .
would not recommend ! i'm writing this review at 5pm while still sitting the patient room waiting to be seen by the dr ! horrific office staff . rude , unwelcoming and i've been sitting here since 3 15 for a 3 30 appt . a 3 30 appt and it's 5 00 and i haven't seen a dr or anyone else . i'm only here to get my mri results from a test ive already had . i will be finding another dr as i don't need to deal with someone who so downright disrespectful of my time . i am beyond disgusted . i don't mind waiting but just tell me i have a 5pm appt like why did i come at 3 15 just to hang out ?
food is always good here . the management will go out of their way to make sure u r completely satified . this seems like a good company .
ooommmmmggggggg this was the best sushi i've had in a long time . very attentive staff terrific on ambience amazing selections of very flavorful dishes . the staff were so fun . great music while you enjoyed your meal . i'll go here again .
great service and efficiency . i finally found hairdressers that know how to cut men's hair . women there appeared very satisfied as well
the worst place to eat food is disgusting , got charged twice to my card . server paid another table bill with our card . manager is super rude
this place is cool . i enjoyed the free comedy show on thursday . thursdays also boasts $ 1 . 75 busch light cans plus 2 deep fried bacon wrapped hot dogs smothered in nacho cheese with fries for $ 3 . 95 . what a deal ! thursday also had goldfish races right after the comedy . this place is a trip . it has a stage that looks like a 1960s living room . lots of fun stuff here . the name alone just rules . i only take one star away from a perfect 5 because the service was a bit spotty . i hate having to wait for another beer when i'm drinking .
very disappointed in quality of service from the waitress and quality of food . atmosphere was nice and great for visiting but the waitress really made this review bad for me . i would give them another shot .
very nice spot for a first date coffee . with decadent deserts . and a date night feel .
used to be the best and my favorite place to come for refills on my lashes . because they were newer , it was easy to get same day or next day appts and everyone is nice . i was so happy when this location opened . i have had a lot of stylists here who were good and finally found one who was great . she recently left and i got frustrated because i started to come every 12 days due to lash fallout . i travel a lot and i've had my lashes done probably 10 times in the last 3 months . not this locations fault . i called to tell them my frustration for the last 2 visits here and the front desk girl was nice . said she was putting notes in and to come the next day and they would do something ir give a discount or consultation . well . i went and no mention of anything or even a consultation as they mentioned to figure out what is going on . all the locations say something about a change in glue that caused problems . i brought up what the girl on the phone said as i was paying and asked her to check the notes . nope , nothing . no discount . no help , no apology or consultation . if you go back within 10 days a few times , it should be a mini fill but no mention of that . just disappointed as i've been coming here for about a year . poor customer service .
this place is small and darling . not only is it cute , it's delicious ! it's also clean and very friendly ! what more could you need ? !
atlasta was the only caterer that got my vision of wanting food stations , not a buffet or appetizer station . they were so easy to work with and made us feel like they would do anything to ensure our day was perfect . they were very open and patient to all of our many changes and made our night perfect . they're food is also delicious ! it was not your typical wedding food ! it was modern and yummy . they also did a late night snack bar for us which included dipping apple and floats . they had never done that before so i appreciated that they made it work and it was awesome ! the bar service was great as well . there was never a line and they were very nice . atlasta was amazing to work with !
ok this pizza place , dom demarcos is awesome ! so excited to be moving back to las vegas near them . and they are delivering now ! yeah ! i've been coming here since it first opened . their pizza is delicious , their chicken caesar is delicious too .
robert my installer was kind , respectful and professional . he completed the work , cleaned up everything , illustrated the use of the system and charged me the exact quoted price !
i love tropical smoothie cafe ! the experience that katie has provided has just made it better everytime ! katie is uplifting , knowledgeable , and always vary positive ! thanks you katie for the great experience you have giving me !
love this place i'm a regular ! great food , good service my fav part is free salted freshly baked chocolate cookies ! yummy !
i love indian food and this place knows how to do it right . my boyfriend goes here once a week and they know him by name , that's dedication . you can range on how spicy you want it and i love spicy , but after one pepper it's almost a wrap for me . it's a small restaurant , i've never dined it and we've always ordered out . it's authentic and delicious , definitely a must if you're in champaign , il .
just picked up two orders of meat lasagna to go . they were fantastic . it came with salad and bread which were also good . i will be back next week .
really happy with two recent orders . gorgeous arrangements ! delivered as asked with no issue . loved how full and beautiful they were made . i'll be back .
i ordered delivery , the food came earlier than anticipated which was great ! i got the individual meals , beef hunan and also ordered the orange chicken one too . both were delicious and had enough for left overs ! the noodles were soft and incredibly flavored . now not everything is perfect hence the 4 stars , the soup spilled while being delivered to us which made a mess in the kitchen which also made me not be able to try it . next time i would ask them to wipe the sides and make sure the lid is secure on the top . i will order again !
brian is absolutely the best promoter in las vegas . he knows everything and everyone and can do anything ! thanks to him our lv trip was an amazing and unforgettable experience . thank you brian !
atria's has this funny reputation in pittsburgh . some people think it's just the best thing since sliced bread , and others , like myself never really understood . i finally was afforded the opportunity to go and found it to be passable . mind you , this review obviously pertains only to the south hills location . maybe the other s ? are very different . we had lunch and i was able to photograph 4 entrees and personally try the soup beef and barley and a salad seafood cobb . the soup was good but unimaginative . but then again , it's beef and barley . i think it's kind of the point . actually the beef itself was quite good but there were only a couple pieces in the cup . it reminded me that the one consistent thing i've heard about atria's is the pot roast nachos . so maybe next time . the beef certainly gave me hope . the seafood cobb salad decent but not great . the dressing i chose light balsamic was weird and gloopy although it tasted ok . the seafood was ok , and relatively fairly apportioned . the salad itself was basically an american mix primarily consisting of iceberg . neither of the two dishes were anything to write home about . however , one of my lunch mates had the meat loaf and he stated unequivocally that it was a 4 out of 5 stars . and i have to admit the plate did look delicious . the other two had fish tacos and chicken piccata respectively . the fish tacos were well received although not memorable , while the chicken piccata was decidedly unappealing . conclusion meh , i guess there's a reason why i haven't ever gone . pretty much exactly what i expected .
awesome midwest breakfast food and even better midwest service ! you have to try the home made sausage patty and blueberry pancakes . ask for sharon .
tried their weekend brunch with bottomless mimosas and will never go back . $ 20 per person . after sitting there our waitress needed to be told we were there and she only checked on us once again as we were almost done , luckily we had to go up and get our own nasty mimosas . most did not seem to eat their prime rib because it seemed too rare , by the time i decided to try it , it was way over cooked and dry ! the omelet was the only thing that was ok because it was made in front of you . definitely not worth $ 20 pp , i would be reluctant to pay $ 10 pp . there are much better places in town to spend your money on . the wife and i live near by and just thought we would try it , never again . i will drive across town to get something better
great service . fresh food . we had the crab cakes , cauliflower curry soup , chicken , all excellent .
ordered two bento deluxe and they tasted so bad we left most of them . no wonder this place was empty . there were two staff members inside . one was sitting at a table busy playing with his phone . the second one , who served us with the enthusiasm of a zombie , collapsed on the table next to us as soon as our food was ready and did not move even when we left . i had to check twice to make sure he was alive and breathing . the chicken and beef teriyaki are now jumping up and down our stomach like the animals they once were . the tempura was over fried and dripping in oil . never again .
relaxed neighborhood vaguely irish style bar and grill atmosphere . the staff is very friendly , i was coughing and the lady at the register spontaneously pulled 3 cough drops out of her pocket for me . mostly american food but they have some vaguely irish american stuff corned beef sandwich and the chicken paprikash hungarian is quite tasty . full bar with an emphasis on irish beverages , good place to watch a game , chill atmosphere . great service .
food is pretty good but service is not good at all . i went for lunch and didn't order the buffett the staff acted all put out by that , and when i tried to order a dessert off the menu they said they'd check and see if they had it . it was ok but nothing special .
spin is the antithesis of your old style pool hall clean and modern . antiseptic and charmless . attractive and inviting . dull and soulless . new and intriguing . superfluous and rote . professionally run with good food . less fun the more you go .
we stayed here the night after staying at the palms and loved it again . the only things we didn't like were the pools here compared to the palms . they were over crowded and not as nice as the palms . this was on a week day as well . the hotel room was great and the casino was awesome as well . this place is massive !
hello folks after a night out at the royal , decided to check this place out ! for burritos , i've had far better and far worse . this place is just so so . but i was so torn ! heard so much about this place and it came highly recommended ! the good cool space , half open patio is kinda cool looking over busy college st . in little italy uber friendly staff ! the fact you can choose between small and large , sometimes a large burrito is just too large ! large burrito is a size of a baby d the meh you'd expect a wicked burrito from a place named burrito boyz , too much build up , not enough cheddar , if ya know what i mean . my chicken burrito felt like it had ground chicken ? ! ? why ? isn't it supposed to be chicken cutlets ? it's not my first time eating a burrito good sir ! no a c inside , i was boiling in therr . it's the beginning of the summer so it's fine , but later on phew i don't know guy . it would have been 2 stars but the staff were so darn friendly ! maybe next time i'll try the steak ? bob out from little italy !
omfg ! my favorate store in the universe like honestly it has the cuties things you could ever want . i love buying my jeans from there like no joke that place is hot . the girls that work there know how to dress and are so pretty . i love shoping there i shop there like 20 times in a month i cant stop going there . like just walking by there gives you the feeling that you have to entre . if you dont entre you d die from regert . im literally head over heels for this place . you need to go there . they have cutie shoes and boots . and they always have a sale . my fav sale they hold every year is you buy one thing and the other thing is a penny . o no one can beat that . lol
awesome service thank you ! from robin who hooked me up with numbers and did a she could to help cut our tow bill down , to bob and linda who brought us and my baby all the way to town from halfway to sedona you all have our business for life !
we tried the sandwiches and crepes they been good but didn't exited us like the tiny shop we found on a road trip to annapolis . also the opening times are not as great .
there are mixed reviews on here and i can appreciate why . depending on the day and time you go , it can be calm and relaxing with great selection or mobbed and a poor selection . also , you may get alot of help or no help at all . just be aware that it's a popular place during the weekend sales and the interesting pieces may all be sold out . then a few days later all kinds of great pieces will be out on the tables . very hit or miss . if you are prepared and know what you want it can be good , but don't take things personally . some people have rough personalities and your serenity may get dented . but this is phoenix ! the big city . that said , there are some interesting exotic pieces and good quality semi precious stones .
they were quick and helpful ! they took care of my oil change and gave me a great discount ! super nice staff .
i recently moved to gilbert from las vegas and hadn't been out too much to explore until my friends came to visit . i loveee ice cream and had received a coupon in the mail from rock n' robyn , so i figured what better time than now to try it ? ! the staff at the time were two ladies , i didn't catch their names unfortunately the blonde one was very upbeat and friendly when she greeted us . our ice creams were large and in charge to say the least ! i was very pleased with the generosity , and to top it off the ice cream was thrifty brand which is no longer available in vegas ! . one of my friends asked the same staff member for water and she informed us that their machine wasn't working . she then proceeded next door to subway and obtained water for all of us . i was very shocked , her humility and kind actions made me feel very comfortable and special haha . i'll definitely being frequenting this place as often as my stomach allows for the great ice cream and amazing costumer service !
we were here on a late tuesday night , and when we got there it wasn't very busy at all . the value is great , for approx . $ 16 you can get a big sushi combo and the portions are huge ! all of us struggled to finish our combos . the sashimi were very thick slices and there was a variety of fish . the restaurant started to get more busy when it was almost closing time that night . the only bad part about our experience was the looong wait time for our food .
they have a vast variety of flavours and combos . i love their wintermelon milk tea ! prices are about the same as cha time . will go again if i'm in the markham area .
love this place . been here once a week since we tried it 5 weeks ago ! carne asada tacos are the best !
looks like the food has been sitting out for awhile . nothing was replaced when needed . looked disgusting . i even mentioned it to the staff member and she didn't even acknowledge me . the staff were just sitting around on their phones in dining areas . the arcade was nice . but for the price we paid to eat there . it was not worth it !
i had a quote from giovanni two years ago to remake my cushion for my oversized chaise lounge by my pool . it was a big investment , so i put it off for a couple of years . when i called him back , his price had gone up only slightly on the labor . i was glad since i had waited so long to get it done . i told him i had company coming and i needed it completed in 7 days ! he said he would get it done . . . and he did ! he copied my old cushion exactly and delivered it in 7 days . it's gorgeous and the workmanship is great ! i will certainly call giovanni for my next upholstery project .
forget about trying to place a pick up order during lunch . horrible service over the phone and when you go in you still have to wait . what's the point of a pick up order ? !
i work in the business park here , so i come from time to time to grab lunch here . this place has a pretty good selection of gyro stuff and salads and all that . personally , though , i go for the chicken fingers with fries . they're pretty good , and even better when they're paired with their cucumber sauce . they also have other less cool sauces ketchup , mustard , ranch , barbecue , and buffalo . this place isn't super cheap , or super fast . my biggest deal with them is they're slow . it takes them about 8 minutes to get an order out to you , which is too long when you're on a short lunch break . i sometimes call my order in ahead of time , but then i usually have to wait for it a little bit , too .
love love love so glad foiegwa has become a staple in the neighbourhood of little burgundy saint henri . whether it's brunch or dinner this place has won my heart . must order items for brunch are the ricotta pancakes and chicken waffles and for dinner the truffle spaghetti beef tartar bone marrow and foiegras burger
great food , great service and will definitely make this place a regular choice for fresh , tasty italian food .
great food , resonabke prices . also agree with their message , they are really trying to raise awareness of the dangers of fast food , and the owner is unapologetically honest . i respect that .
how do they make the food so tasteless ? and the tartar sauce , has no taste . isn't the point of tatar sauce to add flavor ? meanwhile the wait staff must get bonus points for using the word awesome .
this place is pretty cool ! i liked it so much we went twice in one weekend . i can't think of another restaurant that is as unique as portillo's . the building looks like a diner out of the 50's . inside , the place is decorated in a super cute way with lots of interesting signs . they play oldies music and have ample seating . outdoor seating is available too and they have umbrellas to keep you cool and heaters outside to keep you warm . ordering is quick and the pricing is very fair ! what i really loved about portillo's was the italian beef sandwich with mozzarella . omg , the best beef sandwich in town . they put what they call gravy i call au jus on the bread and it makes the bread it so soft . i ordered cheese fries and the fries are crinkle fries with a cup of cheese on the side . very tasty ! we had the onion rings too and they were a little hard but still good . they have great hot dogs , so says my husband . will have to try them at some point . the have the best italian strawberry shortcake i have ever had . okay technically it is my first italian strawberry shortcake . i have had lots of strawberry shortcake in my day and this was the best . they sell a portion big enough for 2 for a little over $ 4 . 00 . definitely a new favorite spot of mine !
my wife and i had a great time here celebrating our anniversary . great views of downtown , the service was good . however keep in mind it's not a fast paced kind of restaurant , but it's probably to give time to enjoy the views as the restaurant turns and gives you a 360 view of downtown phoenix . the waiter was great and we had a good time !
okay , it might be my mistake for ordering pastries at an indian food place , but i wanted dessert and postmates delivers . i got 2 cakes , some type of chocolate pastry , and chocolate mousse . all the cakes and pastries were gross . they all tasted like they've been in a refrigerator with indian food . shocker , i know . the mousse was okay at least , no taste of indian food . maybe the indian food is better .
this place is amazing . it quaint right in the heart of busy charlotte . our entire meal , which included appetizer , entree dessert , was superb . we understand how this place has been here forever and are just sorry we haven't discovered it sooner . ja'crispie
they did outstanding install of engineered hardwood flooring on two bedrooms and two hallways . brian , the owner , went out of his way to find materials . initially , we considered using home depot with their engineered hardwood flooring . they outsource it to another company but we were not entirely confident . besides , we like using mom and pop companies . he used a subcontractor named mike sharp . his group works very hard he can handle many unforeseen situations . for example , we had a crack in the foundation where he did a wonderful patch so that the flooring would be smooth . also , he did quite a bit of undercutting of the baseboards . the hardwood flooring fits about an eighth to a quarter inch under the baseboard . tip learn the difference between installing regular hardwood flooring and engineered hardwood flooring . we've had engineered custom hardwood flooring in a large area near our front door for 20 years and it takes a lot of abuse . it can be refinished easily every 10 13 years . another tip always use a licensed contractor . always check the website of the arizona registrar of contractors to see if they have any unresolved complaints . some companies claim they are licensed but they are not .
before our trip to toronto , i've done a lot and i mean a lot of research before deciding on khao san road . so here we are , starving and tired after all day of walking around toronto . we got to the restaurant and were greeted by a group of people waiting their turn to be seated . after few minutes the waitress hostess came out to take our names . it took about 30 min from the time we got there to the time we were seated at the table not bad . we ordered yellow and panang curry , which was delivered to our table within probably 15 min if not less . the food itself was delicious ! flavorful , spicy , colorful , well presented , and did i say delicious ? ! our water glasses were constantly refilled by a very nice and attentive yet not noisy waiter . this place might get loud , especially in the back of the restaurant where we were seated , so if you don't like noise you might want to ask for a table outside or closer to the front . i would definitely visit khao next time we are in toronto !
second time coming to this restaurant , the first time was at the location downtown st catherine and i wasn't a huge fan . this saturday decide to stop off somewhere to eat before heading home and we didn't want mcdonald or subways . it was pretty busy but we were seated quickly in a nice section not the bar . drinks came quickly which is an automatic star right there lol . the cheese sticks weren't my style i prefer mozzarella that's what i thought they were gonna be but it ended up being orange cheese inside super disappointed . mini burgers were packed with flavour and sweetness . the salad was great could of been better with big croutons but the chicken was cooked well and chopped up nice and thinly plus very well seasoned . service was over all great food was good i would come back to this location
don't get me wrong the food here is amazing ! but the way we were treated tonight was terrible and enough to make the food not worth going back . after ordering our food , we were told a server would come to our table for us , because we specifically asked for them to order some drinks from our table since we hadn't decided yet . once we sat down , we waited at least 15 minutes . a woman brought our food and i asked for our server to be sent over . another 20 minutes passed and once we were almost finished with our food , our server came over . all he said was did you need something ? we ordered our drinks , and then finished our food and waited and waited , and finally about 20 minutes later with no sign of our server and no drinks , we left . terrible service , and yes i understand the way that hopdoddy works .
a nice option for fresh , hot pizza . inside new york , new york . a group of 5 guys had no problem devouring several large pizzas for lunch . recommended .
way too much bread in deep dish pizza ! i ordered a mushroom and garlic deep dish and the thing was huge and heavy . took the first slice out and was very disappointed . i was expecting tons of cheese and mushrooms , all i got was bread . couldn't even taste the garlic and the mushrooms were obsolete . very few ! sauced smothered all over the top . it wasn't even hot . had to heat in oven to crisp up bottom a little and make the tiny amount of cheese gooey . for $ 25 we picked it up i'd think it would have been loaded like other deep dishes i've had . the online menu said the large was 16 . 99 . it was 18 . 95 . never again will i order from here . very dissatisfied .
i love quiet storm ! i think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine . the country burrito is bomb ! so good , there has to be crack in the gravy . i also enjoy the tahini queso , i often add it to my burrito . it's best on the nachos . for around $ 13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast brunch coffee tea included . they also have great pastries dairy free coffee drinks milkshakes ! it's a vegan dream come true . it does get a little crowded during saturday mornings so expect a wait , but completely worth it . the atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area garfield which also means they often play good music ! last time i was there it was all neil young ! accompanied my burrito perfectly ! i definitely recommend this place to vegans non vegans alike !
love the beer selection and the fun atmosphere here . the stone fire pies and wings are awesome plus they have a great late night menu ! definitely worth a stop in oakland .
everything you have heard about this amazing cafe is true ! the service is spectacular . food is incredible . the menu is diverse , a little bit of everything . the staff is friendly and accommodating . outside dining is beautiful in the evening .
delicious tarts and excellent iced latte ! this place was like a page out of alice and wonderland and i loved it !
this is a new theater and it is amazing ! they serve beer and wine . how awesome is that ! the chairs recline too . i felt like i was in my own home watching a movie on a big screen . getting tickets took a little longer than other places , because you have to pick your seat before going in . besides that , everything was wonderful . i will definitely be going again soon !
love coming to this ulta because it's close to where i live and the customer service is amazing ! i appreciate that there is someone on the floor that always asks if i need help finding anything . also want to give a huge shout out to nikita at the benefit brow bar for always delivering on some amazing brows ! not only is she friendly and professional but she gives insightful tips as well . need your eyebrows done ? ask for nikita ! also her makeup is always gorgeous too !
petals and twigs is located on the 3rd level in toronto life square . as soon as you get off the escalator , you can't help but being drawn to this beautiful little flower boutique . i needed a bouquet of flower for a house warming party that afternoon . i had never ordered flower from petals and twigs , yesterday was my first time . they have fantastic selections of beautiful , good quality flowers . the lovely , cheerful and bright bouquet created for me while i was waiting was beautiful and elegant . our friend loved it . customer service was great very helpful and friendly .
this place was good but not as good as the rio . it has different food like indian . it was good overall but i was just too tired .
atmosphere is fantastic , and the staff are great . i really like the selection and that they make a point of highlighting their local drinks . the food was also unique and delicious . however , based on this site , i was expecting the average price of an entree to be less than $ 25 . granted , i don't know what their happy hour prices are i've heard they're good .
taco tuesday ! this place is now my go to . we sampled almost every taco cause i never met a plate of tacos i couldn't conquer . when we arrived we were put on a wait . which with a hour to go . kinda surprising . but , we found a nice spot at the bar and decided to go to town . drinks a little on the weak side but for $ 5 margarita . you win and you lose some . service was on point and all of the bar team were very friendly . dessert brownie was delicious a lot of salty , sugary , overall deliciousness . highly recommend the value here is tremendous .
a sugar shack in the heart of st henry . no need to drive 30 45 min out of town . they offer local ingredients and at 30 $ adult and 20 $ kid for an all you can eat . the only thing is that you will not find any ham , sweet sausage in syrup , creton or oreille de criss on the menu . you do have bacon and mergez . still . it would of been nice to have , at the very least , some oreille de criss . onto the food . bland ! i think they were out of salt , vinegar . anything that would give life to the food . the only good thing was the bacon . even the mergez was dry and overcooked . the slaw had no sweet vinegar dressing . the pancakes tasted like they came from a box . the soup was tasteless . the potatoes , beans , the eggs had no salt . none ! even the desserts were bland . the sugar syrup in the flan wasn't caramelized at all . the sugar pie , kid you not , lacked sugar . huge disappointment ! i was coming here expecting much more since they described everything being made with passion on their site . not worth 30 $ . not even 10 $ . service was good though .
i loved the still it was awesome . tvs everywhere you look the ultimate man cave . the food was so delicious . the chili cheese dog was massive so only order one at a time haha . the chips and salsa were great to snack on while waiting for our cocktails . cocktail waitresses were so friendly and super cute . loved the outfits . i got to meet the chef from the still . he was calling out orders on the outside of the airstream . it's cool how you can interact with the kitchen and see them making my food . thank chef jamie for the amazing meal . i'll definitely be back
i love this place . the decor , the customer service and the food ! i'm here in vegas on vacation but i ate at this place every single day since i got here . they servers were on top of things . the second we finished our drinks they were already back with a refill . literally . i tried the oysters , menudo , tortilla soup , and the chilequiles . i have no complaints about any of it ! they were all delicious ! i'll definitely be back .
if you're going to get a tattoo it's wise to do some research first on where you want it done and by whom . there's nothing wrong with being picky , and if need to pick one place in toronto that offers both appointments and walk ins , new tribe is a good choice . it's clean and the staff are friendly . the artists are talented and experienced . everyone i know who had been tattooed or pierced here has been satisfied and would go back for more .
food was very good . customer service leaves much to be desired .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte ! everytime i come here , it is packed ! best thing to do is to download their app , so that way you can put your name on the waitlist when you are within a decent radius of the restaurant . they do not take reservations . the food and service is on point ! i am vegan so i love that they have alternative options like the veggie burger which can be substituted on any burger choice . they also have veggie sushi too . the bar has lovely drinks , half off martinis on tuesdays ! i have never been disappointed here , the eclectic options on the menu allow this to be a worthy destination restaurant in south park !
we had a groupon like many other reviewers . i will agree that the atmosphere is very un phoenix like , and for that , i'll give them props . it's a very relaxing place to be . however , i also like food , and well , i didn't like the food here . we got a pulled pork sandwich and a salad , and with two iced teas , we exceeded our $ 20 groupon . ouch . i wouldn't be upset about that if the value were good , but read on . the bbq sandwich was two pieces of sandwich bread topped with a portion of meat that was so wet that the bottom piece of bread was soaked . it was rendered a knife and fork entree . that wouldn't be a deal breaker , except for the fact that the seasonings were weird . it tasted like coriander or something else exotic . it was too sweet , not tangy spicy enough , and didn't have good pork texture . joe's bbq makes my paragon of a pulled pork sandwich , so maybe it's not a fair comparison . however , the farm fell way short . the salad was mediocre , but i was surprised that they're pre made and not freshly put together . not a huge deal , because they're probably only a few hours old at most , but it was a bit of a disappointment . overall , our experience was a letdown , since we were so enthralled by the atmosphere and had heard good things . perhaps some other sandwiches are better than the bbq .
ok here is an update on putt putt . my daughter crista got stuck again this afternoon because the little bastardo wouldn't start . 30 minutes she tried . finally it started . she calls me but i was at the gym . i actually heard my phone which never rings at the gym as those who know me know not to call me at those times . but i answered the phone and it was her telling me it took her 30 minutes to start the car . my smart child said should i take putt putt to pep boys and i said make a beeline girlfriend . of course it's the frick frackin starter . helloooooo . crista walks in to the garage and , oh did i mention my daughter is gorgeous ? anyway . the guys couldn't do enough . $ 50 bucks off , rotated the tires , great customer service and putt putt is back in action for another 20 years . woot .
great freshly made falafel . the salads are top quality . they have poster that detail the nutritional benefits of their ingredients . it really shows they care . excellent .
wouldn't recommend this location . the food was ok , but the service was crap . the table was sticky and dirty , they forgot my drink order , forgot to mention there was gratuity included , and took forever to bring my friend's change back . the waitress was very rushed and abrupt unapologetically apparent in her annoyance that we were there . hey man , i know it sucks working til 10 on a saturday night , but try not to take it out on the rest of us .
early dinner during happy hour . carnitas were top notch guacamole fresh salsas with little taste . the place was more like a take out place with eat in patrons served on scratched up plastic plates that look like they really can't be sanitized . the plates put a damper on the food for sure . $ 3 draft beer during hh . if you like non distinctive beer there are 5 or 6 to choose from .
my husband and i stayed recently here for a wedding . we were placed in room 338 it was a perfect room for what we wanted ! privacy proximity to the main pool and lobby are always a must for us . all of the staff was friendly and the golf cart drivers were beyond knowledgable and helpful ! the resort grounds were beautiful and the spa was a sanctuary . we did not have a chance to eat at any of the restaurants on the property , but the food served at the wedding was delicious . sadly , the cocktail hour had hardly any food , but our main course was great . our weekend getaway was an overall success and we would stay again !
convenient hotel for the airport and or subway and go transit . staff was friendly with quick check in . free breakfast includes the standard residence inn fare of fresh cooked scrambled eggs , sausage , ham plus a waffle station , cereals , etc . the eating area is a bit smaller than most , and the hotel has signs in the elevators warning of potential busy times . evening snack that can fill light dinner requirements several nights a week . beer wine was available for purchase upon request .
for a moment you walk back into buffalo with amazing tastes and smells ! the chicken finger sub and bbq wings were delicious and crispy ! a must for all buffalonians !
we have been going to thai food corner for years . it is our all around favorite thai restaurant in mesa . great food , great prices . yes it's small and not very fancy , but it is still our favorite . i always get massaman curry and the chicken satay . love it .
if you haven't already heard , this is the best thai place , value for money , in the city .
cannot even say enough how much i love alicia and chris . we decided to elope and had two weeks to plan the entire wedding . chris was great throughout the entire process everything from general questions to recommending a wedding venue . alicia did our photographs and , from what i've seen , they are nothing less than amazing ! she put both my husband and myself at ease . we took a good mix of fun and serious shots . she just made the entire process so easy even for my husband who hates having his picture taken . i can't wait to see the rest of the photos ! don't hesitate to book them now you won't be disappointed .
i visited this rink with my church's youth for a party and i really liked this roller rink . the staff was friendly , the rink was clean and not slippery . it has an arcade with about 7 or 8 games and a snack bar ticket redemption . the bad part was that there was not any special types of skates
one word forgettable . it's only been a couple months since i was in here , and already i've forgotten what we ate . i remember the group we were with . i remember the service was attentive to our large party . and i vaguely remember the interior . but the whole experience was just , very , forgettable . i even had to double check to see if i've written a review of thyet , is place or not .
i previously ordered t shirts so from roadkill and was happy with them . i tried ordering again but never received the shirts . after many times trying to call and contact with no response , i had to contact my credit card company to have the charges reversed as fraud . not sure what was going on with those guys but not good .
i was incredibly disappointed with the selection and quality of food . i'm really not that picky with buffets . as long as i can find 2 or 3 items that i genuinely like , i walk away happy . i could barely find one item that i truly enjoyed . i should clarify that this buffet isn't terrible . i just expected better from the palms . edit i received some free buffet coupons in the mail , so i gave the place another chance . it was night and day . i actually enjoyed everything i ate and some dishes were even spectacular . i particularly enjoyed the scallops and bowtie pasta dish , the root beer pulled pork , and the drunken mushrooms over mashed potatoes .
great mexican food for a late night on the run , or for lunch . i prefer the carne asada quesadilla and a coke , but that is my fix at most dive mexican food places such as this . the prices have gone up since they moved from mcdowell rd . , but they are still very reasonable and still serve good portions . it's like many mexican food trucks . you better know what you want when you go to order or you may be ignored . i prefer to take it to go as there is very limited seating and it is a food truck so it is outdoor , which in summer means hot . give this place a chance if you're in the area and like the hole in the wall feel or no walls in this case ! .
great dj , played really good hip hop . good crowd all the way around , and my bartender was awesome . you could tell they had good customer service training . the bank salvaged my saturday night , which started at a terrible spot . i will definitely go back when i'm in town .
jake is one of the most honest guys i've come across . highly recommend tempe auto repair they do an unbelievable job . i showed them a quote i got from another company and they told me i didn't need to do half of what was on the list after looking at my car . good guys over there .
we had a lot of tacos , half lengua fries , and horchata . fries good , but lots of sauce and sour cream on top . the meat was good , but towards the end , the softness fluffiness started to bother me . would skip next time and get another taco , since we were stuffed as well . tacos 1 . adobada x2 delicious 2 . suadero great 3 . buche x2 chewy , good 4 . al pastor good horchata not as cinamon y as i like , but good . price $ 21 for 2 people verdict we tried lots of different things , so that was fun . the different lines are annoying . the food was greasy , but you already expect it . i'll stick with taco y taco since that's closer and because i think i prefer it .
amazing food ! due to unforeseen circumstances we showed up almost two hours late for our reservation and just before kitchen closed and they couldn't have been nicer . absolutely adore this restaurant , their service , and their food !
looking for a place to wash a huge comforter . this place fits the bill without making me nervous while i'm there ! clean inside , decent machines and plenty of them .
was all willing to give your over priced super salty empanadas another shot at glory , man . but when called recently , over an hour past your stated open , no one picked up . i've worked pizza and deli places know how it can be . tried four more times to get through . screw you , manolos , we are so over . don't come crawling back next week with your lame excuses .
if you think you've had a sandwich , you are wrong . prior to going to this place you have not had a sandwich . you have only had meat with bread and toppings . here you will receive a true sandwich . with bread freshly made and toasted in store . the holiday turkey should be on your must eat list should you ever find yourself here on the holidays . it tastes like thanksgiving on a sandwich . while the idea of cranberry sauce on a sandwich may not sound appealing to some , rest assured they do not use ordinary cranberries and the quality shows . the sandwich ingredients crunch well which highlights their freshness .
the bouillabaisse was the star of the show . one of the best i'd ever had . i'd come again if i were in montreal again .
nachos are an enormous portion and delicious . this spot features a ton of tvs for watching the big game and space to hang outside . the margaritas were pretty tasty and happy hour begins at 3 daily .
came into roundtable buffet for lunch on a monday with a group of 9 and were seated right away . the space in this buffet is massive , lots of tables and a large area for food , as well as drinks . but during lunch , only 4 sections of buffet were open for lunch , and honestly , there wasn't such a diverse selection to choose from . you've got your chinese food , salad bar , a couple choices for pizza , a small meat station and other forgettable items . i was deeply disappointed in this buffet , should have read the reviews before hand . but ! i do have to give it to them for desserts , there was a wide selection , and it wasn't too terrible . and there was a great variety of beverages to choose from . but i wasn't here to drink and eat desserts . because there weren't many diners in during lunch , the service was very attentive . even so , i do not think i will be back here .
think bejewelled everything . hats , shirts , belts , etc . i'm not a fan .
awesome seafood and really great service from the waitstaff . the crabcake my husband and i enjoyed as an appetizer was spot on . just awesome ! everything we ate was exceptional . interior wise , i think the ambiance is lacking a bit and feels significantly like a bar . this place is so amazing that if the inside had a higher class feel , i think it would really step it up a notch . i wouldn't go here for a business dinner because of the seating situation and set up , but it's great for a family meal or if you're looking for a more casual experience . we're looking forward to eating here again soon !
have gone to this place both for a small breakfast on an off day , and a mother's day brunch . even though it was busier than heck , they had a great buffet breakfast thing for mothers day which was wonderful . you got a table , waited in line for food , and ate away even seconds ! so delicious , and the service is always superb . quaint little place , if only i was in gilbert more often .
i was strolling around noda after some meetings and was looking to cop a hearty lunch with a cold adult beverage . i walked into jack beagles and sat at the bar . it was a very inviting atmosphere and the staff was friendly . as i checked out the menu , i noticed that they gave many of the dishes colorful nicknames . i thought to myself , this concept can either create a local legend or go horribly awry . at that very moment , i saw a cheesesteak they offered called the stugots , which is italian slang for a variation of stu cazz or stu cazzo i . e . my d k or my balls , or my d k and my balls terms used interchangeably to express ones defiance or disbelief in something or someone courtesy translation for the ethnically challenged . needless to say , i had the cajones to order the stugots . i asked the chef to add green peppers as they were not listed in the menu description . he balked at the idea for a second , but then threw a few on the grill with the onions , steak and pepperoni as per my request . the result . boom . it kicked off like a loose forward . i have since drastically reduced the amount of red meat in my diet . if you are likewise , they offer it with chicken as a no cost substitute . they have a pretty good beer selection as well .
my laptop stopped working , so i have to ship it to toshiba for repairs . i paid $ 30 for shipping . it took 3 days to get the prepaid box . called 1877fedex to schedule a pick up . the rep told me a driver would be here today to pick up my laptop . she even asked me what was the lastest they could come today . i said before closing and have the driver ring my bell . i'm not sitting my package outside . it's now a little after 8pm . i called them at noon . come to find out she put in my pick up for monday 4 18 ! and the best they could offer was for me to trust them tp get here by tomorrow between noon and 2pm . no thanks . i spoke with kathryn who is in the customer appreciation dept . i know they open up by 8am . but no residential pick ups until after noon ? considering they are asking me to sit for 26 hours and it was their fault . you would think they would get someone out first thing in the morning . they are horrible . i used to love fedex but their service has hone to hell . i wish i could have used another carrier . i would give 0 stars if i could !
in the path , you often find the typical starbucks , second cup , and even now a mccafe . though they're fast and sometimes cheap . i'm just dying for a good coffee that perks me up without the sour acidity of bad old beans . thankfully i found sam james in the path and at 2 pm . zero line up . they had both sides open with a barista so it was quickly moving the very short line . the barista was pleasant and was able to start making my almond milk dirty chai quickly . for their smaller size , this came up a little more than $ 5 . i will say the espresso shot was very good as it balanced the sweetness in their chai mix but i was a bit disappointed on how the spice flavour was a bit mute . i think next time i'll try their cappuccino instead to see how their drinks measure up to my favourite around the world . tip . they only take cash !
i used to love this place ! it's awful ! never again !
seriously , the best fish tacos in the valley . they are a great size and just the right amount of breading . the fish is juicy and delicious and the homemade sauces just top it off . the staff is great and the place is extremely clean . go for taco tuesday , such a great deal !
seriously people . stop going to other wing joints . this is probably one of the best places in town and the best prices in town and the best flavors in town and the best gat damn deserts in town . of course its all subjective but i havent met one person that has been here not say one bad thing . the other wing joints charge a lot more and the attention to detail isnt there . you wanna support local businesses ? come and support this one ! plus the food is awesome and so is brian . ask him to sing some sublime for you . yes i heard you singing while you were cooking brian . haha
i am sure that many people who come to las vegas to gamble or vacation and who have a large tolerance for smoke can enjoy this hotel . i came here for a technical meeting and found this hotel very inappropriate for that purpose . my single star is in that context . 1 . walking in and out of the hotel from either my room or the conference section , required walking through a very long and very smoky casino . smoke gives me a headache . 2 . the air conditioning seems to connect all sections of the enterprise , so the air quality in even nominally smoke free rooms was poor . 3 . everything costs . there is no in room coffee and everything in the shops is expensive $ 3 . 25 for a cookie . bring your own hot water pot and snacks . most of the staff was pleasant and helpful , but i did note that the indian guy ahead of me in line at a buffet in the havana room did not get much interest from staff when he asked about vegetarian food .
the food here is always good . this place can get very packed on the weekends so honestly plan ahead . also it's worth the wait . if you ask for oj you will get fresh squeezed oj and it's oh so good . the dutch baby is so yummy big enough to share . their apple pancake tastes like an apple pie . my family and friends have eaten here so many times over the years and we have never had a bad time . staff is always great food is always amazing . even the coffee is good !
barre3 is quickly becoming my all time favorite workout . i'm in my mid 30s , was never super active , and barre3 is a perfect mix of cardio and strengthening , not too strenuous but still an awesome workout . as a special bonus , the owner vicki and all of the barre3 instructors are incredibly friendly , down to earth , and great at their jobs ! the class format is typically 30 40 minutes of aerobic cardio mixed with movement yoga positions . the remainder of the hour is deeper stretching and strength building using mats on the floor . class is a full hour and the time flies ! the studio is also new , clean , and easy parking . they have a variety of time offerings and i think provide child watching during class too , although it's not a service i personally need . the only thing that makes me sad is the price increase in jan 2018 , i think class is now close to $ 20 class packages are a bit less but still steeper than some of the other places i go in the cle suburbs .
yum a licious ! freaking good pizza ! thin crust extra cheese ! mmm ! i'm not sure how this place for such bad reviews , the pizza came out perfect !
this is my favorite coffee spot . i get a caramel nut latte that is curated to perfection . i drive more than 20 miles to this place . not only for great lattes but for the great guest service that is given .
great place . i come here for bike boxes when i need to ship something big . they always come through . i've bought tires here as well and they carry everything from budget minded components up to high end stuff . very knowledgeable staff . great place to go .
i'm very confidant in the skills of thomas erased tattoo being able to remove my tats . the office is clean , high tech and so is the equipment . the treatment stings best way i'd describe it briefly , and is redone every 4 8 weeks . he's working on removing all 4 of my tattoos , and i will be very happy to see them completely gone . i was referred by other very satisfied customers . great pricing !
i came here for a 30th birthday party last weekend for the first time . everyone was extremely helpful and the room that my friends family had reserved was very nice . the food was very good and the atmosphere was intimate . i would come back again for sure .
i came here for a quick non las vegas strip lunch and was surprised as to how much i liked everything ! there are not descriptions on the menu , but the friendly cashier will gladly explain what each menu item is . we ordered the hummus , club sandwich and asian chicken sandwich . the club sandwich flavorful and had a lot of meat . the hummus was just okay carrots were slimy . my asian chicken salad had a hair in it but the way vig deli recovered was excellent . they offered me a complimentary chocolate bundt cake yum ! , had my new salad out in a couple of minutes and checked on me to make sure everything was okay . salad is mostly cabbage mixed with cilantro and a little arugula i believe . nuts and croutons to give it a crunch and juicy chicken . i will be back for more .
inexperienced stylist , overpriced and not doing what the client asks is a big no no !
nice little coffee shop off midvale blvd . i came here in the afternoon and the workers were quick to serve us and the coffee always tastes great . the inside is cozy , but is semi small , so if you are looking for some place to study there may or may not be a decent space . more so good for brief meetings and get togethers with friends for a cup of coffee . nice decorations on the ceiling large canoe and around the walls . large parking lot as well so you don't ever need to worry about parking .
top notch outfit ! friendly staff , great location and a very nice experience was had by all present . safety training before you use the facilities is provided for all first time visitors , and the store also has many wonderful things to check out and rent if you are so inclined . once all your ammo is spent and the toys are stowed safely away , there is also a nice clubhouse where visitors can enjoy a beer , cocktail and or a fine cigar afterwards a great place to talk shop and make new friends . highly recommended to say the least .
made a 1 00 pm appointment . arrived at 12 45 pm . it's now 2 30 and i am still sitting in lobby waiting for my name to be called . first time at this facility . i am having a serious eye issue or i would have walked out long ago . finally went in . technician and dr . were great . swec reached out to me next day to explain wait . put new steps in place for emergency type appointments . have a follow up appointment in a month . fingers crossed i will be seen on time .
it took me 17 minutes to get through the drive thru . what i thought was going to be a quick pitstop to grab food , became a long and annoying wait . i got home to find my tacos thrown together in a mess and cold .
great food , decent portion sizes , good prices , awesome food choices . nice layout and a lot of space . drinks are average .
this place surprisingly ranks the top places for dim sum . added bonus of having a great view . great place to take guests from out of town
we may have caught them during a extremely busy time since there were two large conventions going on . the hostess was very friendly and kept our table open even though we ran late by almost a half hour . the burger was cooked to my liking and my colleagues seemed to enjoy their lunches as well . the servers i think could have clarified the options a bit more , but nonetheless the service was very friendly and prompt !
ratings food 6 10 drink 9 10 service 9 10 value 6 10 hygiene 9 10 aesthetics 7 10 i came here for brunch on sunday . i had heard quite a bit of positive things so we had to give this place a try . a few of us ended up getting the brunch bowl and one of us got the mushroom benny . i added a side of home fries after looking at the portions from adjacent tables . the brunch bowl was absolutely mediocre , the eggs over cooked at the bottom and undercooked on top . the rib meat was flavorless and bland . the greens were old and bitter . one of the egg bennies was overcooked , so they replaced it with a proper poached egg . their fresh juices are pretty tasty , but they are on the expensive side . the place looks pretty tacky on the inside and decor is not my favorite . the service is good and they're courteous and polite . it's not a bad place for brunch , but i can think of many other places that do a better job .
we were so excited to find out there was an authentic japanese crepe place in toronto ! the store is quite small , with limited seating available . there are stools outside for people to sit on , which is nice . we got the pork belly okonomiyaki crepe . the crepe was piping hot and freshly made . it was tasty and quite a good size for 8 $ . i shared it with someone , and it filled us both . the pork belly seemed like it was boiled . i would have preferred the pork belly to have been grilled or flavoured more , as it tasted bland . all i could experience was eating fat , which is not pleasant unless it is done right . i did however enjoyed the other toppings that they added into the okonomiyaki cabbage and bonito flakes . it was good nonetheless . i will have to come back to try their cakes . perhaps that would change my opinion .
not happy with my recent experience .
we just found this awesome new place ! new owners . very friendly . the food is excellent and fresh ! our favorite is the 1 assorted hot . their bread has true italian taste ! we now come here weekly . we highly recommend this place ! you won't be disappointed .
enjoyed a tucson favorite on top level el guero canelo sonoran dog although 5 $ more than in tucson . big game vs rockies same division race with la . come early for batting practice . fyi rockies done sign autographs maybe because they lost 8 in a row ? a friend i . the oc coached with nolan arenado's dad i . little league now he's an all star . still i'm routing for az . fyi only 23k here on friday pm in a competitive divisional race game .
this clinic is awesome . i brought my kitten here for her shots and a wellness exam . the clinic staff are incredibly friendly and helpful . i saw d d'arcy and she too , was absolutely incredible . it's evident that the people who work here love their jobs and the animals that they treat ! dr d'arcy even sent me a follow up email after my appointment to make sure that i had all the information i need as a new pet owner . the place itself is clean and bright everything is orderly and it does inspire confidence . prices are also very fair . now if only i could find a family doctor for myself that is as wonderful as dr d'arcy was to my kitten !
best tacos ever ! they don't have a huge menu at all . its pretty much just a taco shop . but the best taco shop ever ! especially if you sit outside . you feel like your at a family gathering and like the meat tastes like it literally just got off the grill ! i have no idea how i'm going to not go back there everyday . this is the only place i'll go when i want tacos !
our first and only time here . first , you have to pay for the chips . what mexican place charges for chips ? i saw something black in my ice in my soda . i am usually the person who tough things out at restaurants but that was gross . the layout is like it will be quick but we waited over 30 minutes for food . i can say , though , the guy working tonight was a trooper and apologized for the chips fee and the wait . my food came about 5 minutes before my husband's . he ordered a burrito chimichanga style no sour cream . it came with sour cream and looked like it was baked in bbq sauce . we decided that would be our only time ever eating there .
i visit phoenix occasionally for work and have passed by this pizza place several times . in the evening , the you can see inside the restaurant from the street and it has always looked very inviting . i had some time tonight and was on the hunt for pizza . i stopped in and was immediately greeted by a server named vanda . she was awesome . very attentive and took some extra time to help me decide what to have for dinner . vanda made an appearance often . i don't like when i have to scan a restaurant to see if my server went home for the night . vanda stopped by the table often to check in on me . i had a fall harvest salad and a mott street pizza . the salad was amazing . it had pears , dried cranberries , almonds , gorgonzola cheese with a zinfandel vinaigrette . the pizza had pepperoni , sausage , bacon , meatball , bell pepper , and tomatoes . i just found my favorite pizza joint in phoenix . i'm not sure what will cause me to return more the great food or the great service . i guess it's both . perfect combo . the restaurant is clean and the decor simple and perfect . music and tv's . i'll be back for that fall harvest salad tomorrow since i ate just about the entire pizza by myself . 5 stars ! check 'em out !
found our favorite chinese restaurant . the food was hot , fresh and delicious . and super large portions also . the service was friendly and attentive . we ordered the family dinner a came with soup , egg rolls , ragoons , chicken fried rice , sweet sour pork and kung pao chicken . it was soooo yummy . glad i live close by because i go there about 3 4 times a week . love love love this place !
amazing service received . thoroughly impressed with brian mcclay and crew . i would highly recommend the service department .
the beers here are way upper upper top shelf . the mad scientist , mad chad , has concocted a many of fabulosos to tickle thou taste buds . this is an a place to enjoy at anytime when they are open . or try their beers at the many local bottles shops in and around the charlotte metro area .
the most life changing , mind blowing experience of my life ! the superhuman life is the only way to live ! there is no better way ! i feel fabulous , look great , and am so much more aware of how i live my life ! it started with a simple yes to the super human transformation ! sht4life no one has it put together the way paul does !
this stupid rag newspaper continues to show up in my mail box they are the original meaning of spam from an old man with nothing better to do with his lame time .
my sandwich was huge and really quite tasty ! service was super friendly and quick for there only being one person working i assume matt , but i could be wrong . easily worth going out of your way , and much higher quality than you'd get at a chain . a !
love my gym the day walk nick and jack were there with open arms to guide thru this journey i'm going thru . anytime fitness is not like all those other gyms the atmostpher like family besides being very clean . just got new equipment love them
going to the q or progressive field ? stop in for a drink at the bar or get a full meal in the dinning room . bar tenders are always helpful . the wait staff for dinner will get you out quickly if you need to get to the game or concert .
my favorite breakfast place without a doubt ! best pancakes ever ! love their skillets and huevos rancheros they have delicious benedict's as well ! only ever had an issue once where my food wasn't hot enough , but that's an easy fix . it's worth the 35 minute drive every saturday morning
great little spot with amazing garlic bread and the best eggplant parmesan anywhere . i'm vegetarian so i get eggplant parm a lot and this was definitely a winner . the service was great and the wait staff was pleasant and accommodating . we'll definitely be back !
if you are a candy lover , this place is out of this world . there is everything that you can possibly imagine . as i meandered through the store , i was overwhelmed by all the sugary confections to try . i was sold on the counter with all the chocolate goodies . peering through the glass , i spotted chocolate covered potato chips . what an odd concoction ! however , i was blown away by the harmony of flavors or sweet and salty . i even came back for more . i think we spent a good hour in the store just playing . it was really fun looking at all they had to offer . they obviously are known for their spinning , bedazzled lollipops endorsed by the likes of the kardashians , holly madison , and the pussycat dolls . be prepared to pay $ 22 30 for those . i enjoyed the goodies as much as the entertainment factor the store had to offer . and service is impeccable .
this starbucks is one of my favorites . the staff member that took my order was paitent and took the time to assist me with a few coffee related questions , my drink was made correctly and per my order , and the store was clean . note , this store isnt usually packed full of customers , which is nice when you need to find a seat .
i was surprised to find out the grand luxe was a chain restaurant tied with cheesecake factory . i personally don't care for cheesecake factory so this was a pleasant surprise that their menu vastly differs from their counterpart . their menu was pages and pages in length . i wanted to order so many items ! staying at the palazzo in december had led us 6 girls not want to venture out much in the cold and just dine in primarily the palazzo or the venetian . it so happened that we ended up here for both breakfast lunch and dinner this past trip . for breakfast lunch they offer lunch specials for a reasonable price and from the looks of what my friends ordered , the portions seem filling to the point of having leftovers . after a night of drinking , i always crave soup . my friend mentioned pho earlier and we read the zen noodles description which sounded like pho so i thought to give it a try . it tasted similar to pho , but lacking flavor . it did come with chili , basil , and bean sprouts . it did the job and hit te spot and was enjoyable . for dinner , i had an ahi appetizer which was fantastic . it tasted very fresh and was accompanied by 3 types of salad carrot , cucumber , and bean sprouts . the cucumber and bean sprout salads were delish but the carrot salad really didn't have much flavor . i could say that i enjoyed both my meals and that i wouldn't mind coming back . on the other hand , some of my friends cared to disagree . for lunch , my friend wanted a pickle to add to her sandwich but they said they didn't have pickles . not a big thing to me , but this displeased my friend . for dinner when we came back , they had 2 soups of the day cream of chicken and clam chowder . 3 of my friends ordered the clam chowder and maybe 20 minutes into waiting , the manager had to come up to our table to apologize and say they ran out of clam chowder . what a disappointment to hear that the chowder was the special but they didn't have any left because they ran out of clams . on both lunch and dinner meals , service was lacking . it took at least 20 30 minutes wait for food . water was scarce and so was the waiter . food was good but questionable if worth the service wait .
their website states that it's a 20 minute wait . i waited 2 hours and 12 minutes for a sore throat . the doctor spent less than 2 minutes with me and told me to gargle salt water . i told him that online it states that it's a 20 minute wait and he said , that's a lie ! it always says that . needless to say , i won't be back !
ok ok , only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is , and even they will admit , service sometimes , can be pretty slow . they need more servers ! i know it saves them money but i think they lose business because of sometimes how spread thin the waitresses are to like 6 tables . now me being a local i know that they have that problem but people coming into the restaurant aren't greeted by anyone and sometimes for a minute or two . pobrecitos , i bet they come in and think well , off to another restaurant . so enough about the cons , how about the pros the hot sauce , is to die for ! i buy that stuff by the jar everytime i come in . it has this great balance between texas and mexican food . i always tend to get the sandwiches or the burgers , and my girl always gets the chimi's or the enchiladas . we can't help but sample each others food obviously and neither of us could find anything that wasn't amazing . so bitz ee keep doing your thing but get some more help ! don't make yourselves look bad to newcomers !
i've been here several times but tonight i was in a rush bc i wanted to go see my mom so i ordered takeout the bar manager coleen is the best her personality is awesome and she's very knowledgeable of everything behind the bar such a nice person she even put a flower in my drink check her out and the foods always good here
consider this week my car dealership phase . given that most of the living world hates buying cars , i feel that it is important to shed some light onto the good and badder than bad adventures in carland . yesterday , i shared a badder than bad , but today i am happy to share a delightful experience ! this is all about my sales experience , as i have never gotten service because we did not end up purchasing a rover . so , we're not officially ballin' , but i really wanted to make it rain at land rover . the ride was smooth but not a limousine for all you prince fans , and our sales guide was just that cool . first of all , her name was cookie ! being a misti i automatically feel a kinship with peeps that have what i will call cute names . cookie was super laid back with zero attitude , and she had cuh razy stories about the myriad of characters that roll through the door . she was also low pressure . she called to follow up one time , and then she was gone . now , i liked cookie , but in when it comes to car salespeople , i like it when they're kind on the lot , and then are kind enough to let me go about my life . cookie really provided an ideal visit to the land of car sales . she is like glenda in the land of oz . or something like that .
for the price and the availability it was pretty awesome . amazing atmosphere and the food was also just as tasteful too . the price is pretty high but it does reflect quality of the food ! great area to also people watch if you are into that lol . definitely a place i'll come back to again when i am in town !
we went to lavo for my birthday dinner , and it did not disappoint . definitely the best of the three restaurants we went to for dinner during this most recent trip to las vegas . for an appetizer we had the meatball and it was super delicious . how could we not order something called the meatball ! and i had the chilean sea bass , which was so perfect with a crispy outside and tender inside . and to top it all off they brought a happy birthday dessert with enough for all four of us to have a good portion . thanks lavo !
my wife and i bought a new mattress a couple of months ago and realized that we picked the wrong one for us . this one came with a 90 day sleep trial we really appreciate the wonderful customer service we received when replacing it with another brand . we will definitely shop here again in the future . i also love that the employees don't stalk you like it some of the other furniture places . but when you need help they're there for you .
dined here on 5 17 . average at best . food ok , margaritas eh . service ok . ambience eh . there's two other similar restaurants that i can think of in las vegas that offer more authenticity , tastier cuisine and much better margaritas . try viva zapatas on e . craig rd . if you're in north las vegas or lindo mihoacan on flamingo rd . in east las vegas . you'll get more bang for your $ .
love this place ! down home cooking . the banana pudding , available on sunday , is to die for !
come here around 4 30 or 5 and they never have steak or chicken ready or cooked , horchata is completely empty and they have 8 9 people working and nothing is ready for the dinner rush
we decided to grab dinner and take a break from christmas shopping . when we entered there was only one other table that had people dining but when we left the place was full . our server was very sweet and was constantly checking in on us . we ordered the crab angels , chicken satay and kung pow shrimp . the king pow shrimp has a very light crust on it that was nice . the shrimp were huge and there were a lot of them . we had asked for a level high heat but it was more like a two . the crab angels were crispy and the filling was delicious . the chicken satay came with two sauces a peanut sauce and a sweet sauce like a duck sauce . we would definitely go back to try their sushi and pad thai .
the wedding and service up to the day of was great ! the only thing i would suggest to anyone planning to get married here is to make sure you read all of the paperwork . first there are no outside pictures allowed . meaning none of your guest can take pictures on the property ! secondly don't buy any floral arrangements on your own . they're not allowed . you can only use there's , which of course is for a fee . last but not least the packages for the pictures are ridiculously priced . we paid $ 351 for the slideshow and three posed pictures exactly . it's a lot ! oh and the 19 charge on everything ! oh and they move quick . they will get you in and out of there fast . no socializing or anything . smh . i didn't really get a chance to even hug my guest who flew all the way from chicago to las vegas just for my wedding !
couldn't be happier with the work they did on my propellers and my drives . adam goes the extra mile by even picking up to make things easier on you . customer service is great and full of knowledge . all in all i had a 5 star service and was very pleased with how long the return was ! i strongly suggest to look no further and give adam a call . thank you adam for taking care of me getting me back in the water !
found this great local place while droppings kids at school across the street . they have a great selection if flavors and make some great lattes and holiday drinks . they also have tasty baked foods to offer as well . found their coffee to be superior to starbucks . awesome drive thru service . friendly family owned place . they offer punch cards and i keep coming back scored a free drink !
this w is amazing ! staff is incredible . i brought my mom here for a mother daughter trip for her bday and they treated us like royalty . sophie and sandrine are the best concierges in the city . they recommended the best restaurants . they were so thoughtful and sent a bday champagne and cupcakes up to our room . hotel is in a great location we walked to most spots place de armes , norte dame , les enfants terribles rooftop bar etc only downside is that we were on the 3rd floor and we could hear music from the club on the 2nd floor all night until 3am .
gross ! reminded me of school cafeteria food . i had to get full off of mashed potatoes and gravy . my husband could only eat the french fries and bacon . honestly the worst food that i have had in vegas so far . plus side is its cheap . you get what you pay for .
quite literally next door to dante's restaurant , dante next door serves up a limited menu and limited hours to cater to the brunching crowds . personally , i'm not a huge brunch person , but my friend wanted to try it out so i agreed . we were the first to arrive at 10 30am and we were the only guests in the restaurant , but things certainly started to pick up after 11 00am . our server was friendly , and was able to describe the specials and answer all of our questions . i ended up trying the margherita pizza while my friend got the omelette special . i found the prices to be a bit higher than i expected for brunch . the margherita pizza was decently priced at $ 10 but all the other pizza options were $ 13 and up while the other more breakfasty options were between $ 10 and $ 13 . my friend was happy to find that their orange juice was freshly squeezed , and we were satisfied with the quality of our meal , but the pizza was pretty similar to all of the other wood fire oven pizzas i've tried . good , but nothing unique . the saving grace was the nutella pie . i'm not a huge dessert person , but this definitely wowed me . it's definitely more creamy and rich that straight up sweet , which i enjoyed . i would definitely order this again if i returned , but on the other hand i don't really have a desire to brunch here again . the ambiance is a little too modern for my taste and somewhat eclectic , but not in a very thoughtful way . it definitely feels like an add on rather than an actual conceptualized restaurant . overall i wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here , but i could say you'll probably be decently satisfied with your brunch here if you don't mind paying a little more than average .
i live close and it's so great having a fast , friendly , reliable and affordable place to go to . i was in and out of my oil change appointment in 33 minutes . this is my 4th time coming here for my needs and i have had the same experience each time . thank you !
firsts time visit here , and got take out . cantonese chow mein and stir fried rice noodle and beef . large size is great value for what you get . i seek out the wok hei in the rice noodle dish , and it's definitely there . great place !
as a clevelander who moved south about 5 years ago , i was very excited to stumble upon this brewery last saturday before we went to a concert at first energy stadium . the beers here were tasty , and my non beer drinking brother was happy that there was liquor available as well . the brick oven pizzas were awesome the steak fajita was a and the giant everything oven baked pretzel was a . this is definitely a much needed establishment in downtown cleveland . i look forward to making a stop back here next time i'm in town .
this place has a great brewery atmosphere , something sorely lacking the the danforth . they make their own beer , right across the glass wall from the main dining room . their own beers are fresh and tasty you can taste the freshness ! we had some usual pub fare with the beer , wings , burger , etc . it was all good quality and decent , including the price . the service was standard . great place to get a microbrew and some pub food !
the location is good , and the patio can be wonderful on a winter afternoon . the food , however , seems to be about 20 overpriced for what you receive . it isn't bad , mind you , but it certainly isn't worth the prices they charge . the bar area gets very , very crowded on friday nights , which can be good or bad , depending on what you're in the mood for . it is a nice place for drinks , and maybe appetizers . skip it for dinner , though , and try someplace else within walking distance in old town scottsdale .
great place to chill on the patio with friends ! loved the patio ! their margaritas ate good and the food was delicious ! good vibes all around here !
easy to schedule an appointment online . dr . crawford was on time , quick but thorough . the lady who did my procedures prior to seeing the doctor is amazing and i hate i don't know her name ! very convenient location for me so no complaints .
yuck , just yuck ! my boyfriend and i came down to vegas for a weekend getaway . there were 3 of us girls and 3 guys . the boys wanted to hit a few stripclubs without us so we went to a thunder show . way , way tom much raunch , it was kind of gross . i have no desire to touch or be touched by strippers and there was way too much contact , i know some women are desperate for that kind of attention from men but not all of us . didn't want to go anyways but will not be back .
yeah , i would go back and play in their poker room again . it was smoke free which is a rare treat in vegas . dealers and fellow players are friendly .
wow ! first time here , we ordered the arugula salad and the margarita pizza . amazing ! service , amazing ! environment so nice and music was great too . i'm coming back !
incredible products as well as fantastic customer service from the business owner , sarah . the village in which she is located is absolutely beautiful . the scents that she creates are a personal gift to you . all natural ingredients are evident when you use them . thank you , sarah !
i hesitated coming back to this location but it was the closest to our events that day . service was much better today , possibly because it was mother's day . the food , as always , was high quality . my husband enjoyed his asian salad , the lon ricotta pancakes had a delicate lemon flavor that was good , although obscured if you put syrup or strawberries on them . probably would prefer simply with whipped cream . the chicken pomegranate salad was excellent .
this was the worst clubbing experience i've ever had . promoter eric shine offered my group a table outside at an all inclusive rate of 1 , 400 tip , tax , drinks and then offered an upgraded table inside for 1 , 500 . we booked the table inside . when we arrived eric was not present to escort us in and the staff at xs said we could not have a table inside . we were charged 2 , 000 for the outside table . it took over 40 minutes for drinks to arrive to our table , bouncers wouldn't let us on the dance floor because it was overcrowded , and we had to listen to wonderwall . if i wanted to throw money away , listen to outdated acoustic songs , and stare at a mass of sinners dressed to the nines i would go to a church . i will actively discourage everyone i know from attending xs .
we have been going to the persimmon for years . we love the food and the quality of the ingredients . if you have friends visiting make sure to take him here because you will surely impress them
this is a small theatre , but it is big in value ! they offer your less ordinary , indie type theatre that is a nice change from your shakespeares and grease snooze fests . if you are looking for a unique and fresh theatrical experience , this is the place for you !
katherine has been doing my hair for over a 3 years and absolutely an amazing stylist . i am beyond picky with who i select to get my hair done by . i am from new york so i am use to having a good stylist and i know the difference between having a person who knows what they are doing and those that don't . i know when i am being pressured into a test object and when someone really knows how to treat my hair and not just what they want to do to my head . i know when someone will say i understand you want to do this , but honestly as a stylist i cannot recommend this for your hair , you only doing damage and those professionals are very hard to find . i have had those bad experiences of people testing on my head as if i am a lab rat . well , look no longer because this young lady is amazing and you won't regret her taking care of you and doing a great job . she takes her time , she's respectful , she's professional and very welcoming . it's hard to find a good blow out spot in arizona , especially when you are use to a great ny blow out . well , az folks , she is here . she started at nyc salon in mesa and now taking her talent to a new spot . give her your support , you won't regret the experience of the hands salon . her hubby is also a barber and in the salon as well . so if you have a hubby , child etc . , one stop shop ! you want people that's loyal , that you can open up to , say things to that won't assume or take it personal . if you tell your stylist you don't want something done , it's not a pressure and they can say ok i won't do that ! you want someone , that's professional at all time and that's open and honest with you , if you build professional relationship with . they can be open and honest at all times . you want someone that care your hair and not just style it or you becoming their test object or lab rat . you want a person that values your hair and care your hair ! i highly recommend her at all cost and on all levels !
rei used to have the best customer service . over the past few years , i've had several negative experiences with the madison store . first was a defective rei jacket zipper which they refused to warranty , second was a ripped big agnes tent seam they refused to facilitate the warranty had to go through the original manufacturer directly , which worked out fine . most recently , i bought a roof rack that came with a defective part small metal adapter ring with stripped threads . i live an hour away from the store , so i called to ask if they could warranty the part through the mail , and they told me no , the only option is to bring the part into the store . fortunately , yakima was kind enough to mail me a new part directly , so i'm back in business , no thanks to rei madison . in the future , i think i'll shop online .
writing a review for ikea is like writing a review for mcdonalds . the experience is so ubiquitous , why bother ? and yet , i feel impelled , because a manager did something exceptionally nice for me today . i've been shopping at ikea all my adult life . my sister and i go wild for it . my first beloved ikea was the one in staten island . when i learned charlotte would finally get its own , i went ape sh t . ikea has brought so much joy to my life , i've considered writing it into my will . sike so , i'm normally in out before noon but today i sashayed in with the multitude around 11 30am . i arrived at the restaurant jonesing for breakfast to find they were already serving lunch . i desperately wanted crepes with ligonberry sauce . the lines were obscene , so i knew i'd have a slim chance of charming the manager into making me a special breakfast batch . poor odds ignite me . i asked . she said yes . she smiled . i was shocked . i wanted to lift her up and twirl her around . restraint prevailed . as promised , my batch was ready in 12min . i slid pass the crowds , collected my bounty , headed to checkout and thanked the manager , alexandra , again . bliss .
probably wouldn't stop here again . customer service was terrible . had one girl roll her eyes at my order in separate bags , then i wanted to change an order and it was a pain to them to have to accommodate it . awful service but the desserts were first rate .
at golden steer i finally found a ribeye steak better than i can make at home . if you are a steak lover and in vegas make the effort to find this place . everything about this ribeye was right the quality of the meat , the proper melted marbling , the correct seasoning and the temperature . just fantastic ! if you order a potato be sure to have someone along to share it it's huge ! if you looking for the best steak rather than the coolest atmosphere this place should be your destination .
if i could give it a 0 . i would . worst place ! don't go . they never have the food you want ! not fresh ! one of the employees aggravated me . been races . for no reason ! horrible employees ! slow ! always training employees due for the manager hiring the worst people ! don't go ! i don't recommend !
horrible . dont waste ur trip here . at least my experience was . i was craving denny's , and the wait was longer than i was told because kitchen was backed up . we got skipped as well . the manager sat us in a rush , very unprofessional he seemed frustrated . he's given that position to deal with situations like these , right ? my server was good ! a young man named cheston ? i believe . our food was gross as well . my food was over cooked and i had soggy stale fries . my food was also something i didn't ask for . very disappointed . what happens in vegas stays but not my experience , i'm taking this to yelp !
my wife has me supporting local business instead of the other place that originated from wa . i really like the black white coffee drink hot and recently i've noticed the breakfast menu available , nice ! . but i am not understanding the doggie as the logo or mascot i recently became a cat lover , so , c'est la vie . different , local , and pretty decent . there's this girl who reminds me of patty griffin the folk country singer who soothes my traffic drives there . free wifi at the tropicana near mcleod . the charleston shop is conveniently next to 15 freeway . i am not really a monster drinker but their smoothies creation does the job . $ 2 tuesdays are now every day on a 16oz'er . the end .
met a friend for brunch last saturday was totally disappointed in not only the level of service but the quality and taste of the food . the omelette center was runny and uncooked and the extra side of peppered bacon greasy and under cooked . the noise level was high and a chaotic environment topped it off . i remember the first yours truly that opened in shaker now , that was service good food ! rockside location needs quality control .
over the years , i've watched while the prices have risen steadily , including a very sharp increase right about the time jimmy john started building that obscene house of his . hmmmmm . i wonder if there's a connection . meanwhile , quality and quantity of ingredients has declined substantially . what was once my favorite place to grab a sandwich isn't even on my list anymore . kinda sad . i wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who complained about the avocado . the most insulting part of it is that they charge something ridiculous like $ 1 . 00 a huge amount when compared to the total cost of the sandwich to add extra avocado . in my experience , even if you pay for extra , there's still not enough on there to actually taste it . paradiso is located in the same building as the jj's on lincoln , and is a much better sandwich for about the same price . i'd recommend going there instead .
i really wanted to like this place hearing that they are from italy . but i really dont have much to say about it . i had a regular cheese pizza and my best way to explain it would be it seemed watered down or watery if that makes since . i also didnt care for the cheesebread
want a relaxed experience and a yummilicious meal ? try pinky's west side grill . only drawback was the loud traffic but the outdoor dining was great otherwise . best today crab puppies ! woah nellie ! i'll make it back soon to this dd d joint .
cool place ! we stopped in for dinner , and while the place was kind of dead , had a great inexpensive meal unheard of vegas . those chips are damn delicious and nearly ruined my 3 steak taco dinner . happy hour is pretty nice , 2for1 on bottled beer as well as 1 2 priced apps . my buddy says this place is usually rockin on a thursday night , and really something special once rehab starts up in may .
the illuminati may be a secret society that this coffee shop's theme is based on , but it's no secret that illumilatte brew society has some amazing coffee . i had the salted caramel frappe and a giant pistachio macaron . i must say , the salted caramel frappe was exactly what i had expected it to be sweet and that hint of saltiness that you can kinda notice which really balances the drink out . it's served in a tall glass , which to me makes the drink taste that much better . the macaron was so good and it's bigger than most macarons i see in other coffee shops ! they also have a variety of these colorful confections that go well with any drink you decide to get hot or cold . the staff is all super friendly and very personable . who doesn't like big smiles and casual small talk with their barista ? as for the interior , the main wall and the bathroom walls are a cool black and white mural filled with illuminati conspiracy related imagery . it's super cool to look at , and it's even better to witness at night when the lights in the room change from color to color . they have such a chill vibe going on there , that it's impossible for you to not enjoy yourself . plus , they have a good amount of seating with soft , comfortable couches ! the place is great for groups or you can just roll in here solo , either way you're gonna like how everything is here . from the clever name to the outstanding artwork on the walls , everything felt like it came together in unison . it's probably one of the cooler coffee shops in town , in my opinion . i'll definitely try and frequent this place more often ! a !
i love coming to this place . i've been here a couple of times and the food quality is still at top notch ! i love their lunch specials . it comes with spring roll and soup , their spring roll is always crispy and their soup had a kick of spice which i love . i normally get their pad thai chicken ! i have yet to try their dessert , it always looks so good ! my only complain is that their portion is a little bit small for me !
hothouse is a very good restaurant to get together with either family or friends . the menu has a good selection , and the wine list provides a lot of variety . i had a pleasant eggs benedict , and my friends had omelets . we had a relaxing brunch on the patio .
very good vegetarian food and you can tell the chef loves his work .
nice and quiet place to have burgers with friends and family . also , there are some very nice window view seats . the owner and staffs are super friendly and have nice smile . they offer to bring over our combos instead of calling us over .
this is a very nice patisserie at the aria in las vegas . i really enjoyed everything i ate here very much . the sandwiches and pastries are fantastic , fresh and delicious . the coffee and cappuccino is near perfect .
i really liked the food here i like that they had an option for gluten free . my son loves the pancakes here as well . the service was just ok nothing to brag about on the service . however it's worth going there for the food . they were a little on the pricey side and seemed to charge an extra fee for every single thing that you get so i didn't like that part .
just didn't have flavor for me . i know it's really popular . i just don't think it was high quality food for the price .
used to love going here , but the cleanliness of the place has greatly diminished . they're trying to cover the stink with air fresheners , but it's not doing the job . here's a pro tip for sacks management get some water down the floor drains in bathrooms , kitchen , etc . on a regular basis , so the sewer gases don't bubble up all day . also , my last sandwich has a dirty rag sour smell about it . i'm assuming from the dirty knife used to cut it , but who knows . obviously won't be going back .
lizzy is so nice ! she is a true artist ! she knows how hair grows in and how to fit it to your face ! i love the online booking . it is very easy ! she will accomidate any of your needs ! highly recommend her ! you will feel beautiful when you leave !
kohl's is a nice place to shop if you have coupons and stuff is on sale otherwise their ''regular'' prices are super high . the stores are always clean and stocked well . they have a nice juniors department but again regular price on a dress being $ 75 then marked down to $ 37 . 50 is still a $ 37 . 50 dress . at kohl's , which is high . they have small carts you can use in the store which is very helpful in a mall type setting . there is ample parking out back so if kohl's is the only store you need to go in it makes it very convenient . if there is a line be prepared to wait and this happens often on saturday or sundays . i have waited in line for almost half an hour in kohl's which i think is a little long . they always want you to sign up for their credit card . i have gotten some amazing deals at kohl's but you do have to work for it . i still shop there occassionally but not as much as i did when they first opened and had more offers .
a few friends and i recently took a trip to vegas . the only place my boyfriend needed to go to was bouchon , as he is obsessed with thomas keller . someday we are going to make a trip to california specifically for french laundry . but anyway ! we had brunch here and it was beyond phenomenal . we started off with the mussels and words cannot describe them . we thought we ordered the dozen but instead we were brought the larger portion and it's a good thing they did because we sucked them down . all together we ordered the steak frites , chicken and waffles , croque madame , and gravlax . i don't like salmon at all and i loved the gravlax . the croque madam was ok hot but got sort of unbearable when it cooled . i wish i would have got something else bit oh well . other than that everything was great ! it was one of my friend's birthday so at the end if the meal they brought her a complimentary lemon tart of some kind . wow ! the service was amazing as well . we never went without water or drinks , and they were so stealthy . to this day my friends and i reminisce about how much food we got and how good it was .
worth to try at least once but i don't think i could come here again . this place is on the pricier end of sushi places and although the quality is good , i don't think it made up for it . our group made reservations for 4 for 7pm on a friday night which is recommended because it does get busy . we ended up ordering a medium sushi boat which gave us approximately 80 pieces and also split a salmon udon as well . overall between the 4 of us , it was $ 27 after tax and tips . service was ok and we got our food fairly quickly .
it's very very average but one of the very few sushi options in the area . we had grilled saba , a medium sashimi plate 45pcs and 6 malpeque oysters between 4 people 2 are small eaters . the oysters were decently fresh and okay sized . came with a variety of sauces to accompany including a ponzu , horseradish , tabasco , and marinara . the saba was grilled well . it didn't come with sauce , i'm used to some tangy ponzu or teriyaki sauce on the side . when i asked for some sauce on the side , i was told it didn't come with sauce and if i wanted some teriyaki sauce they'd charge me for it . really not impressed with that . it would've cost them 5cents and they wanna charge me for it ? the saba was done well but really put off by them wanting to charge me for a little teriyaki sauce . the sashimi plate was very pretty and the fish was decently fresh . some of the sashimi was flavoured with spices or seared . the flavor combination was good . wish they had mackeral though . they did have hamachi i think . and the tako was good . my favorite was the fatty salmon belly . lots of choices . overall a decent meal , would've been two stars for wanting to charge me for a little teriyaki sauce but the food was actually good so it's a very begrudging 3 . oh and being seated in the back was hard to get service . to be fair they did come around a couple times but when i actually did want something they were not around lol . i didn't ding them tho because near the end my sister dropped a chopstick and almost immediately a server one of the few male ones popped up with a replacement which was very appreciated . but i asked for the bill from another server shortly after and had to wait a long time . finally i just walked up to the cash and paid there myself . so overall a so so rating for service . $ 100 incl . tip for 4 so not bad for price .
this place was great . nice , casual , food had modern feel . can't remember the names of what we ordered but got one curry dish , a noodle dish and a specialty dish and three of us shared . they were all awesome . other daughter had sushi and she was very happy with it . very nice waitress . we will definitely return .
one of the best spas if not the best spa here in vegas . the customer service was great . i liked the atmosphere . it was very clean and eye appealing . vicki was very nice , sweet , and helpful . i like that you can get both your manicure and pedicure done at the same time . definitely will be coming back .
this hotel is fantastic ! the staff is amazing , friendly and super helpful . the rooms look newly renovated and very clean . the breakfast is yummy and the location good . that's the place to stay when you are in phoenix .
wonderful ! we stumbled upon this while looking for a light dinner after a show at the wynn . we had a meat cheese platter that was perfect ! the bread served before the meal is hearty delicious . the meats cheeses are authentic . great atmosphere as well . i should've tried more of the food , but that was plenty !
this was basically my first time moving so i really had no idea how to mange the entire process . i also couldn't afford to screw this up in terms of time and money . so naturally the first place i looked was yelp for a solid moving company . i really couldn't argue with a place with such stellar reviews by fellow yelpers so i decided to give them a try . i talked to justin a week or so before my move to set everything up and get some questions answered . he was friendly and professional and setting everything up was a breeze . on the day of my move , the 2 movers showed up a bit early huge plus in a uhaul which i thought was a bit sketchy but is a pretty genius way to do things if you have your own busy and growing moving company . the movers began working right away . they were courteous , fast and professional . they also went above and beyond by taking apart and reassembling a bed and a large desk that i didn't have time to deal with myself . anyway , the entire move out and move in process was a lot quicker and easier than i thought and went off without a hitch . i would definitely recommend just in time to anyone and would definitely use them again .
top notch , honest prices , and quality work . i've gone here for years and the quality and pleasant demeanor of the employees has never wavered . they take you out , under your vehicle , and show you their recommendations . they give you choices , if you can't afford the whole ball of wax they will gladly scale down the work to suit your budget . i can't say enough good things about this establishment . the warrantee they offer on all their work is unsurpassed as well . a
there's a reason why this place is always packed . because it's so good and worth the wait ! their quality of sushi is perfect , and the low price for your own specialize sushi burrito is amazing ! always go here at least once a month .
we have had 2 iphone screens repaired here they do a great job . i actually thought the second phone was not going to be repairable but they fixed it like new . and they are fast .
needed a place close to work to meet my boyfriend at for lunch . saw the really good reviews and decided to try . the food is super delicious ! even more so the service we received was great ! eileen took care of us and she was very considerate and friendly . i had a single slice of french toast w bacon and my boyfriend had the bacon avocado burger . his burger was really juicy and flavorful i eat taking bites ! i plan on coming here much more often
took my benz here after being told i had an electrical nightmare by another shop and estimated it to be over $ 1k . surprise car care found and repaired the issue the same day for 75 less than quoted at the other place ! i had another small issue that mike and his team fixed again the same day also at a very good price compared to the dealer . a follow up call a few days later from the owner proved that surprise car care stands out from the crowd . for honest auto repair at a fair price this is the place to go !
prices are reasonable , the dogs seem to enjoy it there , and they do a thorough job . the staff was friendly , and i was happy this wasn't a pet smart or other large chain . we will go back am happy to recommend it !
this is my 2nd favorite store in charlotte . blacksheep gets a slight nod but i do love this place . clothing and sneakers are 2 things that i cannot live without , and social status has the best selection in charlotte of the brands that i like . if you're looking for bbc , lebron x corks , yeezy 2s , or the latest limited edition nikes or jeremy scott x adidas this is where you go . i wouldn't even know where to get that stuff elsewhere in clt . house of hoops and dtlr don't get the limited edition stuff that social status gets . your next best bet is online probably . the store's layout and vibe is pretty cool and there's a great selection of apparel , shoes and hats . it's tough to say no . i will say that the customer service is kind of hit or miss . i've been in there on a number of occasions one of my best friends lives down the road from there and sometimes the staff is great and sometimes not so much . never awful , but average at times . and in my opinion customer service is extra important when you're one of the little guys when you're a boutique , small business , or local shop it's crucial to be good to your customers , especially your repeat loyal ones . and that's why blacksheep gets 5 stars from me and social status doesn't . at blacksheep i go for the whole shopping experience the merchandise , the atmosphere , the staff . at social status i go there for the merchandise alone .
i was really craving chinese food so we picked this up a couple nights ago . super fast and pretty good ! we got the plain lo mein , egg drop soup , egg fried rice , and crab puffs . i wasn't a fan of the crab puff filling , seemed like it was just cream cheese . everything else was spot on ! i'm glad it's close and maybe some day they'll deliver
first off i would like to say that the service here is not bad . however , i did observe two employees standing off to the side chatting amongst each other incorporating a bit of profanity and not really working . i was recommended to go here with the expectation that this is the best steak house in vegas . i am sorry to say that it's not true , the fillet mignon wasn't bad but it didn't wow me at all . the t bone steak was better than sucks , it was not bad to the point where i would say it sucked but it was definitely not good . i was really shocked to have not experienced a grade food in a place that's all about the service industry .
this is one of my favourite places for jerk chicken . it's close to my house so , it's super convenient for me . their sauce is delicious , the rice and peas are perfectly cooked and the chicken just falls off the bone . not to mention the super cute staff !
came here at a thursday night and tried their regular menu without wagyu . the best thing and the only reason for me to have ayce is that you can enjoy a lot different dishes . beef is pretty good in quality and flavor , but chicken and pork are not that great . services are not bad but sometimes they forget some dishes in your order . at the same price level i'll prefer the other japanese bbq place for the next time .
i was all set to have dinner at la bourlingueur when we walked past this place and saw the window seats lined with folks diving into their soup a l'oignon and charcuterie platters and knew that this was the place to check out . the restaurant is delightfully decorated and plays stereotypically french music i almost expect rene artois from allo allo to jump out at any moment to offer me some wine . the decorations were nicer than the food , although the charcuterie platter was quite good . a nice assortment of meats and the bread was fresh and crusty . the cassoulet was basically a dish of sausage and sauerkraut , and was probably less traditionally prepared than we had expected . the french onion soup had a nice crunchy cheesy top , but the soup itself was barely warm it would have been much better if the entire dish was piping hot . so i'd give 3 5 for the food , but the atmosphere was terrific 4 5 , so i can bump this one up a star to 4 5 overall for the experience and reasonable prices .
all the reviews referring to the bad service here weren't kidding . the employees could careless about this place . when i asked for water , the asian girl with bleached blonde hair made an annoyed grunt and said ok . when ordering , the guy taking my order didnt know anything about their food items or drinks . hello , is your lemon green tea made with real lemon or lemon syrup ? shrugs i dont know , i think it's real . do you recommend your taro toast or the sesame toast ? i dont know , havent tried either . . hmmmm i'm thinking in my head couldnt you at least tell me which one is more popular ? the staff here does not know what boba is . ask for tapioca or pearls in chinese which is the lingo they use . bad service , you will have to flag someone down to order or get anything you need . employees doesnt care , doesnt give a damn . they will ignore you when you enter and exit the restaurant . loud clubbing music that will give you a headache . drinks are very mediocre to bad . not impressive for the prices they charge .
servers are always kind and self aware with positive attitude still since its always busy . mom enjoys their choices and always trying something new . family have a good time and gets a break from the mexican food .
earlier in the week , my allergies was just a muck . the day before , i had ramen . on this particular day , i still needed noodle soup , but didn't want to make the trip down to my usual . thanks to yelp , i found noodle pot ii . so i made my way up on eastern and made the left into the plaza's driveway . big banner hanging in front of noodle pot ii , grand opening ! awesome ! because lunch hour is 11am , i'm always so happy to beat the lunch rush . besides another family just finishing up , i was the only other patron there . glancing over the menu , they have a lot of noodle soup options , but i wasn't looking for anything too fancy . so i settled on wonton noodle soup to help make feel a little comfortable . the broth was excellent . there was a quite a bit of wonton and even more noodles . i think it could have used a little more bok choy , but i was feeling satisfied , including my sinuses . the decor is of typical chinese restaurant . nothing outlandish nor trendy . and of course , friendly service . because the temperature is heating up , i do look forward to visiting again when we get back to the winter season .
omg this was one of the worst experiences i ever had in a restaurant , to start the lady at the front desk kept repeating her self that the restaurant was closing in 45 minutes , she turn around 2 mexican families away , and then at 746 a white family shows up and guess what ? they get an option of get there meals to go , unbelievable ! its all about them apparently . there is clear tables in the back of the restaurant but there are not longer available because is closing time . this manager in duty is not in control , the employees are . hahaha i'm a facility manager my self and this crew should be ashamed of there selfs . one of the server's comes out and screams no more ! . i don't want nothing free i'm just gonna use my christmas gift card and let my customers and friends know about the service on this place .
pros amazing food ! both quality and selection . i mean dynamite . i have yet to order something that i haven't liked . and i'm pretty sure they change out the menu weekly , keeping your options fresh . great for sharing . many of the dishes are meant for sharing . perfect for those who want to try a little bit of everything ! charcuterie is on point . the first page of the menu is dedicated to all your meat and cheese needs . each selection is 3 cheeses or 3 meats . pair together for the ultimate feast . eat , drink and shop . a portion of the restaurant is actually a market and deli area you can buy wine , cheese and the like . ample parking . there's a huge parking lot on the side street next to the restaurant . very rare for establishments in this area . cons i wish i lived within walking distance to this place . bottom line a great place for happy hour , date night , intimate groups , or solo dining they have something for everyone !
we stayed an extra night in lv and got some room credit so we decided to use this for the brad garret comedy club . and i am so glad we did ! we were seated right in the front of the club , smack dab in the middle . now , for those of you that have been to comedy shows , many comedians liked to pick on the individuals they see . brad was no different . he picked on everyone including my girlfriend and i and it was hilarious ! brad was actually on stage that night hosting the show and he was non stop fun . we also had two other comics perform and they both had their own distinct style and were funny themselves ! the drinks were delicious ! i usually do not do the specialty cocktails , but i decided to just dive in . all the cocktails we got were fantastic ! if you like , there is also a full bar so they can make anything you like . i suggest if you have time to kill and do not want to gamble , come in early to be seated and enjoy a drink or two with your company ! while the show is on you can press the drink menu to make it turn red and the waitress will come by and take your order throughout the show . so convenient ! then you close out our tab before the show ends . i definitely recommend this show . hilarious and such a good time .
ridiculously slow service where we were honestly just going to leave . once it finally came out the sushi was so so at best . i'd never go back .
i do have to say i love the decor of the restaurant and how trendy it was . since it was our first time going which we told the waiter the waiter didn't make any suggestions for the two of us . we both have never had tapas and we didn't even know how much we should order so we are satisfied . the waiter didn't seem to want to help us which have made it more enjoyable . my mother in law has been here 5 times and loves it i will give it a try again since maybe it was just a bad day for the waiter .
i like the booking service . appointments can be made on line 24 hrs with the manicurist that you prefer . i like that aey did not put a nail tip on my severely bitten thumb nails and encouraged me to grow them out . most salons would've instantly slapped tips on them or acrylics . she uses a primer called bond aid which i need . i am going back tomorrow . parking is difficult , but there is a convenient pay lot behind the salon . parking is 25 cents for 8 minutes . aey does not waste any time so you can pay for 35 minutes for a 30 minute appointment . there is no where to stand or sit around and leisure in this salon . i bring my own cnd polish bc i prefer cnd . i miss my salon in dallas , tx .
the food isn't bad , and the prices are okay . maybe the food is even better than not bad 3 1 2 stars , maybe ? everything looked and tasted fresh . the reason i'm not rating the place better is that it's built so that the sound just amplfies and echoes , and this is bad for someone who is hovering on the edge of a minor migraine . when i wasn't picking at my chicken burrito , i was wondering how many people i could stab to death with my plastic knife before the two cops having lunch at the next table stopped me .
ate there a few weeks back for the first time . my buddy had the hash , which was very greasy and over cooked . the waitress recommended breakfast nachos ? not that good . chips piled with eggs , cheese sauce and then put under the broiler until it was completely dried out . the atmosphere and bar etc was very nice . but , not the food so much . my first and last time .
close by and nice selection , especially for something new and exotic . not the best wine selection , but it's great for getting the hard stuff unless they run out or only have the jumbo sized bottle which is not helpful . otherwise , good service , not too crowded , and mostly knowledgeable staff .
i'm in vegas for business . found this place close by . first of all , wonderful customer service . i believe the owner is working the register . great guy , very friendly . menu is simple and on point . i ordered omelette with eggs , mushrooms and spinach . food arrived quickly . it was fresh , delicious , and hot . home potatoes on the side were great , looks like it's their own recipe . overall great cafe to grab a bite . if i'm in town again i'm coming here for sure .
literally love it here . the staff is amazing , very friendly and helpful . they're truly do an amazing job . have been taking my puppy here since we got him and wouldn't want to go anywhere else . we have the wellness plan and for a small set monthly price it's with having i case of emergency . and we u limited office visits you never have to worry an office visit and a discount on medications and other procedures tests .
i came here to meet up with a good friend of mine last week and we had a great time . the cafe is really lovely and cozy . we came on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all . we had some macaroons and coffee and everything tasted really good .
how did not been for me being in las vegas and needed a place to stay i would not have stayed here . i think the best thing i liked about this hotel was breakfast with the gentleman at the bar who served us i forget his name i'm not sure if it was tim but he was funny personable and very honest .
review based on our food from noodle and sushi place my husband was hungover , and i thought we gave this place a try because of all the good reviews . big mistake shouldn't made the decision when i'm hungry . the food is horrible . i ordered the hong kong wonton soup , california roll , tuna sashimi , and my husband order the miso ramen . both our soup was so bland , they did not provide any kind of sauce or seasoning to add . we took two bites and we were done . california roll was pre made like what you get from costco or sam , tuna was good can't really mess up tuna . maybe other soup is good there but we are not coming back here for sure .
this buffet is pretty decent i mean prices are supper affordable and has plenty of options . it's got your basic prime rib carving station , soups and pizza , salad and asian and mexican foods . they have a crepe station which was good . there is a ton of seating and if you get a players card from them which is free at concierge desk you also get a discount ! they didn't have any crab legs which was a bummer . overall three and a half stars for me !
i was at galleria and wanted somthing on the way home . i pondered the usual suspects , chipotle , sweet tomatoes , five guys , cafe rio , etc . before i noticed that a new pizza place was open ! i have just recently discovered pieology , and i like the concept , so i thought i'd give pizza rev a try . the people were super friendly . they were smiling and laughing as i was making jokes about having no idea what i was doing . in the end , i got red sauce , mozzarella , spicy pepperoni , bacon , canadian bacon , spinach , mushrooms , onions , sun dried tomatoes , and roasted garlic . it was an excellent combination , if i do say so myself ! with a drink , it came out to $ 10 and change , cheaper than pieology . the crust here is crunchier , which i like . that plus it being close to my home puts this above pieology for me . i will definitely be back . i might have to try one of their salads or desserts next time , as well !
i like the dark roast beans with the strong and pleasant aroma . the barista made me a great cappuccino with a perfect latte art , very delicate milk foam . i bought one pound beans and the price is pretty good . i will come back if i visit queen st e or corktown . ps my friend ordered a matcha latte . it tastes surprisingly good , better than most of the japanese desserts place .
good food , friendly service , comfy atmosphere , prices that are just right . try the 71 .
great service ! done same day ! no shady shenanigans . very clean and orderly . thank you !
i live nearby , always drive by but never stopped in . until today . boy oh boy am i mad at myself for wasting my time and money on other crappy places . i looooove it here ! finally someone who understands me knows exactly what i want . sharie i love you . i just met her i feel like we've been friends for so long . i'm looking forward to seeing what kind of magic you can do on my toes !
my cousin has nut and cashew's alergy and even after informing them about the same atleast 5 times , they still made a mistake and added cashew in it . luckily nothing happened to him , but we literally had to run and gave him medicines before anyrging happen to him . owner even though understood our language , never came to our table once . 25 discount doesn't solve the problem . ideally , they should have made whole order free , but i am not going to argue for that . also , they add lots of food color especially in paneer curry . please be aware of that . ! my wife also had allergies due to that afterwards . giving 1 star because service wasn't too bad . servers and manager was not as good as thry should have been in mistake they made , but that s fine . i dont know , if they take this seriously or not , but from now onwards , anytime i am in vegas , this restaurant will be my last option . !
came here on a lark b c of the good yelp reviews . this place did not disappoint . the food was delicious , the service great and you shouldn't miss their homemade muffins
gotta say , this place was outstanding . the fried chicken was made to order . piping hot and pure . the two sides we chose were the mashed potatoes holy jesus the flavor ! and the mac cheese my kids are mac cheese snobs and loved it . we are excited to have this little treasure in our backyard . definitely worth your time and money . wish they delivered though .
today switched it up the cheat day wrap . scrambled whole eggs , bacon , cheese , avocado , tomato , rice and your choice of turkey or ham . $ 7 . best lemonade in town lg . $ 4 so happy to have strategically ordered . if it weren't for the always amazing blueberry muffins . $ 3 . 5 , you'd of never been blessed with the restraint shown in even getting a picture of the wrap . life is good !
these guys are my heroes ! my family's move was very last minute because the movers my parents hired stood us up . i yelped in search for movers and came across red carpet . dialed and luiz took my call . he was so nice and understanding about my situation . i called him about 1pm and he dispatched a 2 man team who was finishing a job at the time . they arrived around 4pm to do the job . a great job might i add for a 2 story to another 2 story ! joe and john were amazingly strong and super duper friendly . props to you guys for working back to back jobs . they finished about 10pm . i absolutely appreciate everything they had done for my family . my parents are getting older and i'm just a petite lady . there was no way we could've done this alone . they made the impossible possible ! from the bottom of my heart , thank you luiz , joe john ! p . s . their red carpet on the loading ramp was just too cute !
i have been here twice now , once before the menu changed and once after . the first experience was great . the service was excellent , cocktails were tasty and food flavorful . we had the elote as an appetizer and i had the barbacoa tacos for the main dish . we did not have to wait long for our food . the atmosphere and decor make you feel like you are in california in my opinion . the second experience was similar . the menu changed for the better but did not completely change which i appreciated . you are able to mix and match the tacos which are a huge plus as i always have a hard time deciding . i switched up the app and got the nachos . i would highly suggest ordering these . they are delicious and really worth the $ 9 . two things i was not impressed with the lack of water and water refills . i would think it a restaurant like this they would have someone dedicated to filling up waters and bringing them to your table . this was not the case and we waited at least 15 minutes to even get water . we never got a refill throughout our dinner . the other thing is how messy the tacos are . they are very flavorful but the meat was so watery that it made it impossible to eat with your hands . i ended up having to cut up my taco and eat it . not a huge deal but could be better . i will be back and recommend for a nice dinner with friends in downtown chandler !
i took a day trip to vegas on a saturday in july and wound up at the golden nugget . not sure why , as i'm not much of a gambler . once i had flushed $ 60 down the drain in the slot machines , i decided to do something more productive . grab a cocktail ! i began searching for the right bar , passing a bourbon bar not my thing , a beer bar not in the mood , and then there it was , the ice bar . located just past the lobby and with a view of the pool waterslide area , it looked just right . i grabbed a bar stool and ordered up a titos and soda with a lime . pretty simple stuff . the friendly bar tender quickly obliged and asked me if i would like to open a tab . unsure how long i would be staying , i just decided to pay drink by drink . that's when she said it . $ 12 ! ok , maybe i'm a bit cheap , but i thought drinks in vegas were supposed to be cheap . i paid up and even had a second one . then , i decided it would be more economical to go drink at the airport . a for location and atmosphere . c for drink quality . d for price .
the food was great ! a friend and i had the oxtail and chicken and a mac and cheese on the side ! everything in the plate was great ! the service was fast and the staff were very friendly ! overall we loved our experience
the first time we went to hello123 we sat at the bar and had a fantastic experience . the food , of course , is great . i went again for my birthday and the place was busy and very understaffed . only one server for the whole restaurant on a sunday afternoon evening . because of this the server was extremely stressed and unfriendly and we had a very tense meal . we were even nervous to ask for anything , and exhaled once we left . not cool to be so understaffed , and not cool to have customers terrified of their server . food is brilliant though .
today , january 10 , 2015 , i was not only trying to manage a water boiler furnace that did not enjoy the 20 degree temps from the night before , only to then find out that the temps had wiped out the original battery in my car as i tried to go to work i was not surprised , but when i called motorcars honda where i purchased the car used in 2013 to find out how long it would take that day to get a new battery , the rep could not say could be 1 hour , could be 4 so , based on the advice from the guy who jumped the battery i went to auto zone on mayfield road . curtis helped me out big time ! i bought the new battery in a few minutes , and 10 minutes later curtis had it installed , including attaching a device to the interior that kept all the computer settings saved while the battery was changed ! curtis made a very tough morning much better , and while i may be silly for saying this , on the way home it seemed like my car was running better with the new battery ! probably wishful thinking , but i got rid of one of the days dramas very fast , thanks to curtis ! thank you !
me and my boyfriend had the most amazing massage experience at nv spa ! they arranged us in a couple's private room , the bedding and decor were just like honeymoon style it feels very fresh and clean , the whole session was very relaxing and quiet along with relaxing music ! we had 90 mins and i felt asleep just don't want to get up from the comfy bed , highly recommend to everyone !
i wanted to love tacos el asador . the grungy , hole in the wall vibe just screams 'gritty dope tacos' . well . they're gritty alright . which would be fine , if they didn't cost $ 3 . 55 a piece . i mean i love a questionable taco , when it's authentic , sold for $ 1 out of the back of a van , like the next girl but don't charge me what grand electric charges for pork belly and beef cheek . and it needs to be mentioned how much authenticity these tacos actually lack . the 'chorizo' was colored with what looked like pink highlighter fluid . if a gringo did this i would blame their ignorance , but the staff here knows better . it's shameful . even if the prices dropped in half i wouldn't return because quite honestly , the food just isn't good . it's unfortunate because there is certainly charm and novelty which is the only explanation for its 4 stars and the staff is great . but a word to the wise and the not so bright folks who rated this well stick to taco bell if you're in the mood for mystery meat . at least you'll have enough cash leftover for plenty of pepto .
amazing thai ! don't miss this little hidden gem ! singapore noodles with chicken is our favorite !
food was better than expected . large pieces of fish on small amount of rice , that is good ! lots of fun combinations of sushi . they do have grilled food on skewers and the desserts are good .
la paloma is so yummy . so many different flavours to choose from like 30 or more . my first experience was mouth watering . i had the lemon flavour mixed with raspberries . so good . by far the best gelato place in the city . they only take cash . no debit . as an fyi .
if you are looking for a pho restaurant i recommend going somewhere else , their pho is a little overpriced compared to others . i mean come on , 8 dollars for a combination entree ? theres more out there you can go to and would serve the same amount for 2 dollars cheaper and for the price here at pho avina , you can get extra noodles or other items . other than that , the food came fast and the servuce is good . i would honestly go somewhere else though for a better price and dare i say . better quality .
from the friendly greeting at the door to the great food , this will be on our list of favorite restaurants in vegas . the waiter was helpful and affable and the manager came over several times to check in with us . it was a busy night , so it's not that he had nothing better to do . everyone who works there seems to genuinely want you to have a great experience . i had a couple of the small plates the really good portobello fries and the risotto , which was excellent . my husband ordered the lamb cigars i think that's what they were called and they were delicious , as was his meat dish . we split a cappucino dessert and it was too big even for us to split , but it was like frozen tiramisu . we will definitely be back .
had a very nice skirt steak salad on a cold , winter's night blue monday to be precise so nice to have a decent eatery down here in leslieville that's open on a monday night !
i hadn't been to sprouts in several years . i went because my usual grocery store stopped selling fresh salmon . so i bought some from sprouts and a big assist to yelp here because i didn't even know that sprouts sold fresh fish . i also noticed that their selection was much greater than i previously remembered for all different types of food . the fish was the flakiest , tenderest salmon i'd ever tasted . i'll definitely be going back , not only for the fish , but also for other food products that were priced lower than my normal grocery store .
i should've known something was up when i saw the health inspector from the county there ! it smells really funky in there and at first i thought it was my imagination but it smelled like backed up sewage . not going to lie , the food looks delicious , tasted good , but none the less a trip to urgent care for my symptoms was i had food poisoning . too bad bc this place has potential if they could get their a grade back . i'm afraid this place is going to be on dirty dining channel 13 darcy spears .
glad to found mike very helpful , honest and trustworthy ! very satisfied with the garage door that he fixed . highly recommended !
went in to the deer valley location with a party of six . there were 2 empty tables for eight . the waitress said nothing was reserved , but we would have to wait for a family of 6 at a smaller table to finish their meal before she would seat us . really ? we are fairly new to town and have eaten there several times but we are no longer a fan of this place !
went with the family and it was a good time with good food . i enjoyed trying something new to me . the tamarindo drink was amazing . we tried the yucca appetizer , the green corn tamale appetizer , the fried plantain with bean and sour cream appetizer . really enjoyed all of them . can't say i could pick a favorite . my husband had the chicken and sour cream and my son had the carne asada . they enjoyed their dinner but i thought the appetizers i ate looked better .
i admit the coffee here is stellar . however , the ambience is all wrong . its super dim and crowded ambiance rubbed me a little the wrong way . it's a good place to have a chat with a friend , but definitely the wrong place to go and study . however , every single table was taken by some student ! ? geez . your eyes will go bad if you try to read in that light !
i went here with my 2 girlfriends for dinner and drinks . after waiting 15 minutes to get service at our table we ordered food and 40 minutes later waitress comes to ask us what we would like to eat . we tell her we already ordered put food . she said oh yea let me check on it . we ordered a salad and nachos . the nachos looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp and burned and everything cold and sour cream looked like cottage cheese . after never being asked if we wanted a re fill on drinks we paid and left small tip due to bad food and bad service . 3 of us noticed on bank statement we were over charged from what we paid for tips . do not go here unless you want waitresses to rip you off .
this place is unfortunately really mediocre if not outright bad . its a shame because the decor is nice but the service and especially the food is sub par . hope they can find a way to turn it around as the location is great .
c crust is amazing ! perfect amount of crisp and fluffiness . i interesting location . it is in a house , on the corner , close to downtown b bruschetta ! grape tomatoes and basil , cannetini beans , prosciutto and mozzarella . o omg , is there really 4 cheese on that pizza ! ? ! loved it , great place for a date . the night i went there was a really nice band playing for us out on the patio .
i am really picky about tinting and clear bra on my new vehicles . my first time here and very pleased . i loved the 10 year warranty almost as much as the laser cut clear bra which fits flawlessly . the installer did the best job i have ever experienced . this place is very pricey but first class in quality .
went to best buy yesterday to buy the least expensive modem for my 88 year old mom . i decided to write a personal check in the amount of $ 59 . 53 . mind you i had enough money in my account to cover that amount . to my surprise i got declined . the cashier asked her supervisor who was nearby . i was totally shocked what his answer was to me . he said i got declined because i don't shop at best buy often enough . wow ! do you think i plan to go back to this store ?
this store change to the worse , two years ago they have better quality clothes and the price was better . even the customer service is terrible , they chose who they attend too .
fabian's removal is the best junk remover i've worked with . got me scheduled for a time i wanted , worked fast , no mess or fuss , and the price was fantastic . definitely recommend this company to anybody looking to remove junk for a fair price .
great place for wings and burgers ! service was good . the place has a lot of t . v . s to watch whatever sports game is going on .
their chai latte is amazing ! right when i took the first sip , i knew this drink would be a constant for me for now on from here ! i'm extremely excited to try their other drinks soon !
another hidden gem of pittsburgh , nestled in the deeper ends of squirrel hill . this is my 3rd time here , and the quality of food has yet to stray from delicious ! i'd recommend the house special pho or the bun bo huei if you like spicy broth . however , if you're looking for something different i'd recommend the broken rice with pork chops ! the rice grains are literally chopped in half definitely check this place out if you're ever in squirrel hill !
we didn't stay at the hotel . just a quick tour of the casino floor and up the tower . the casino floor was just too bleh for me . it didn't inspire or make you want to hang around . when we got closer to the top they had a large look a like contest and that was amusing in itself . there were some impressive doppelgangers . the hotel also isn't that close to anything , whether it be the main strip or the downtown area . that's a downer to say the least .
great prices on used hotel furniture lightly used . i furnished my entire 1 bedroom apartment for $ 700 . itzel is a doll . 2 thumbs up !
went the other day with my son , and it was fantastic ! the fresh orange juice is amazing ! i had the wild berry french toast and it was really good .
really great selection , but just can't get past their non competitive pricing . they should just match lower prices on the internet , like places like target does . found a nice pickle ball paddle there for $ 125 . problem is that you can find the same one online for $ 99 . since they won't match prices , i just bought it online . just had to wait 2 days .
what an ordeal to try and get delivery . sure , it was the 26th of dec so i am sure the kitchen was slammed , but then frankly stop taking orders . we were told it was going to be 60 90mins when we ordered at 5 37 . 2 hours later when we called , we were told the driver had just left . another 30mins went by and we called again . this time we were told the driver hadn't actually left this was after being on hold for 10mins . 10 of the original estimated delivery time ! . when we questioned what they lied to us , there was obviously no explanation . when questioned as to a discount for the wait , the person on the phone told us we'd get 15 back in cash from the driver . so over 3 hours later our food arrived , cold , and of course there was no refund . i understand that things happen , but own it and use it as a customer service opportunity . no need for 2 lies and cold food .
this place is amazing . dan dan noodles were spicy but flavorful ! the pork and chive steamed dumplings were also on point with a side of their chili oil . my husband got the house fried rice and was able to add some spicy to the dish . definitely will be back and i'll be bringing friends !
this is the only place where i get my eyebrows done , always get them threaded and tinted and they always look amazing . esha and her daughter they both make a great job !
i love raul ! he always does an amazing job and never fails to satisfy . a true perfectionist , and that is very necessary in my opinion for a hairstylist . it's always hard for me to get my hair as blonde as i like because i naturally have straight , dark asian hair . i've been to other hairstylist and they always embellish at the end to give me the illusion that they did a good job , but i'm always left with a brassy orange tried but failed look . dr . blonde not only fixed my previous hair but he maintains it very well every time . he is a true pleasure and provides a wonderfully refreshing experience . thank you raul , you are the best honey !
wife and i just had lunch here . amanda c was our waitress very upbeat and cheerful and she took great care of us . the food had a great presentation and was fresh . other restaurants just clump their food together . our was amazing . christian the manager was great as well ! had an amazing lunch . will definitely come back again ! thank you .
came here to grab a quick lunch . i live in the neighborhood so the location is very convenient for me and i wanted to like this place . when i came in at 12 30 , the prime lunch time , this place was empty . just us . i wondered why because this place has a very good reviews on yelp . when i was trying to order my food , it was very difficult to communicate with this waiter only one waiter working . i didn't understand what he was saying with his accent and he didn't understand what i was saying with my accent my accent is not that strong and this never happened before . it was a mess . i had to point with my finger on the menu then he finally understood . it took 30 min . for my food to come out carne asada . since i wanted a quick lunch , i was disappointed but i didn't complain . maybe it takes 30 min . for them to cook thin meat medium . the fries that came with it were crispy and delicious but the meat was very tough . their hummus was good and the location is great so i'll be back and order something else when i have enough time to have slow lunch .
great food , fast friendly service perfect for a quick lunch . the interior is much nicer than its strip mall exterior would have you expecting . never drank any of their beers lunch break problems but i appreciate any place that has cold ones available . there's a patio for all of you people who like eating hot soup outside another bonus .
eh . nothing to write home about at this place . everything seemed to take a long time . not sure if it was the servers fault or the kitchen . the servers were very friendly and chatty about the food . the food was mediocre at best . coffee was barely warm . don't know if i'd come back .
food is not bad . however , they ripped us off . advertised on both their menu and website , the price is 5 . 99 for shish tawook sandwiches , they charged 7 . 99 . watch out for secret price increases ! better options in area .
i seldom ever leave reviews , but this company is amazing ! so here goes . i found them on groupon , and called the week before i needed to be moved , to which they said no problem ! and fit me into their schedule . great customer service . i was their second move of the day , they were a little later than i had hoped but still in the timeframe i was given when i called . this ended up being better actually because we were still packing . our 4 awesome movers were polite , respectful , equipped , professional , hard working , careful , and had fun personalities which creates a nice atmosphere on stressful move day ! . our new house has a narrow complicated driveway and they handled it as if it were no problem in their gigantic truck . i'm still impressed . they stayed as long as it took to get everything moved and situated , and we are so thankful ! one tiny suggestion though , maybe make sure all employees wear company shirts to jobs . just looks more professional and uniform than regular grubby clothes , but obviously that doesn't effect the quality of service ! i'd like to preface this by saying that i was not asked bribed pressured to leave a review didn't even know they were on yelp till now . but i see some rude comments on here and , let's all keep in mind that life is hard , moving your own other people's heavy crap is hard . let's all be kind to one another . thanks again taurus ! y'all are great .
this restaurant is consistently one of our favorites and we always take company there when we have them in town . the menu is imaginative and fresh ! the staff is very helpful and prompt . you must have the calypso chips when you go . the carribean candy bar for dessert is definately shareable . try it !
i have to say hands down best place for philly cheese steak in toronto . pretty close to an actual philly cheese steak from philadelphia . the service was excellent , staff was prompt with the order . offered suggestions on different sauces and steaks , so i can't complain . most definitely will be back .
went here with my love and it was great . the food was super good along with fast and friendly service . i will warn you though i'm a spice girl and i ordered level 8 and man ! it was still super tasty but will definitely take down the number next time because i met my match finally . highly recommend trying for vegans and non vegans . my boyfriend who isn't vegan had the vegan pad se eu and really enjoyed it . delicious food for sure .
what can anyone see besides spectacular . i am one of those people that literally feels better and more energized by extremely good food . and this spot hit all my happy places at once . the cocktails were great , wine was great , the food and combinations are to die for and the ambience and decor is spectacular . hey . a view of the fountains doesn't hurt either . i have to also add that the service staff here is amazing . literally treated like a princess here . and every girl loves being a princess thank you !
this is solely for the clerk named linda . she should be put in the back sorting mail and not out front helping customers because she is certainly lacking in customer service skills . she yells at , snaps at and disrespect customers . when one complains she goes in complete denial and victim blames . she one of those that feel she untouchable because she a government employee with seniority so she can treat someone like dirt and feels she can get away with it . linda was a very angry and sad person to me . maybe i just caught her on her bad day but whatever the reason she should treat customers with good customer service not make them cry ! hope the postal master is reading this and do try to fix this problem . clearly i'm not the only one with a bad experience at this location !
my son and i went to planet hyundai centenniel to buy a new elantra . before discussing the purchase with the salesman , mike landau , i explained to him my wish to not engage in the long process of back and forth negotiations that frequently accompany the new car buying experience . the process couldn't have been more pleasant or expedient .
i have been going here for 3yrs . i use to say 5 but it's actually 3 . anyways , i went cuz of financial peace university . and i said why not go to a service . i grew up in a more traditional setting and i didn't care for the music at first . but when i heard pastor kevin preach . i never looked back . i got a little more involved with wow , and made some great friends with some great ladies . this is my home and i love it here .
love the food . shakes are awesome but why does the drive through always take forever ? !
very cool vibe . great , i mean really great beer selection and very friendly owner and bartenders who know their beer and enjoy talking about it . great food and intimate atmosphere . highly recommend hitting for happy hour or dinner anytime you are in the area .
the salad that comes with the meal was nice . different kinds of lettuce , it was nice and fresh . i had the linguini with clam red sauce , it was very tasty . for desert i had the pistachio gelato , that was really good too . everything was really exceptional . i would go back for more .
had a great experience here . ed was very helpful and friendly . i can't wait until i can come back
this was very disappointing . we got there before the spa closed which is 10 on . i had to tell her she we wanted an hour massage . she said no 45 min , ok . i go in the room she massages my shoulders and said that's all she's going to massage because that's what's tense . that was about 20 min i then asked to massage my feet . she said what . she heard me , then she massages my feet for about 3min then left the room came back with some lotion . she put the lotion on my back with stones and left . she said no ones here relax and sleep and left the room the other persons massage i went with was worse . here's the best i gave them a tip and her partner asked for more . i get a lot of massages . this could be the worst
another update . ge was out today . the only thing wrong was a piece of plastic caught in the drain . no part needed at all to fix . so completely misdiagnosed and we went a month without a dishwasher because of an incompetent technician .
gregorio is the homeboy that will make your wildest dreams come true . he does his best to make your experience here a mucho success . thanks gregorio y amigos
what the heck ? ! i used to love this place . easy , fast , clean . not the last 3 times i've come . my car is always dirty at end of wash , i have to point out major errors in the wash . finger prints all over glass not a few dirt left on floor boards , rims still dirty , and this last time the same trash on the floor i left there was still there . i mean cmon you do this for living . i will not be back , and ive been here twice a month since 2014 . oh , forgot to mention the backed up toilet smell last few times in the lobby .
nasty place to eat , bad service , hair in my food , forgot appetizers , use to eat here a lot , it is bad now . sickening hygeine .
before you read anything go here . best pizza place in town because of the great staff especially the owner and the great food . this part of scottsdale really is low on good food . trust me , it's tough to find a non chain place worthy of your visit . desperately craving pizza , i decided to trek to ny pizza lovers to try their offerings . the owner is incredibly nice . he really wants you to feel at home , and it wasn't intimidating at all to ask him any questions or for a box or whatever . it was fun talking with him a little bit about his business . the garlic knots were really good , and the pizza was pretty darn close to new york pizza the best you can get in scottsdale , for sure . funny story a bunch of bratty teenaged kids came in and wanted to order one garlic knot . one . the owner calmly offered to make them one for 25 cents , which is cheaper than the 6 for $ 2 . 99 deal they have , but he said it would take ten minutes to make another batch . they started whining and left in a huff . needless to say , the owner simply smiled and showed me that he can handle any type of customer , and he is more than happy to accommodate guests' needs . please go here if you're reading this . i can't tell you enough . please give this local business a shot . they have all kinds of pasta dishes as well . seriously , go ! and buy the garlic knots not just one !
i went on a thursday afternoon for lunch , and decided to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine . looking back on it , i regret doing so . there was a street musician playing very close to our table and made it impossible for us to converse . furthermore , the musician's large dog kept coming over to our table . being as large as he was , his head could come right up to our table . that's not the restaurant's fault , but just a heads up to anyone debating about sitting inside or not . our server was just ok . if anything , a little less than ok . i'm not sure if she was busy but it just felt like we were not a priority . every customer is a priority ! anyway , the lola burger was very good . so good , that i finished the entire thing . i especially liked the seasoning on the skinny fries . the pork belly pierogi was very delicious . especially the sauce that is drizzled over the dish . michael symon's restaurants never fail to disappoint me . 4 stars .
it was ok but nothing special . i had the new york steak which had a lot of fat in it . my friend had the chicken and said it was really good . my water was empty for some time and i saw the server in the corner chatting with another server . i finally gave up and refilled the water on my own . i won't be back .
good service . pretty good food . clean and small . it's hidden so it can easily be missed . small simple menu . i'm not huge into filipino food because its heavy and makes me feel sluggish but out of many places in vegas this place is definitely one of the better ones and the staff make you feel like they appreciate your business . hopefully they do well .
my 13 month old loves gymboree ! ms kelsey is sure to engage with all the children and the owners . christina and bobby are very genuine and sweet ! my daughter loves coming here and she is always learning something new ! they are very clean and even close early sometimes for a deep cleaning !
dr . kim was on time , easy to talk to and interested in my health and well being . very thorough check up and not rushed . her assistant nicole was very engaging and friendly . i'm so happy that i chose dr . kim . i would recommend her in a heartbeat .
i had a pool fence installed in may . marty and dane were awesome . they explained everything , made sure i had all of my questions answered and left everything clean and tidy . the fence is amazing and so easy to use . thank you for an excellent experience , i will definitely recommend you to everyone .
turned away told my health card was only for prescriptions even though i had a photo of it with me not really sure what else to say other then i probably won't be going back i hate going to the doctor and was feeling very very bad so now i know why i don't go to doctors
great place for kids to make personalized gifts . affordable price point . friendly and helpful service . nice selection of classes . love this place !
best place ever ! lived in the area all my life randomly noticed it about a month ago decided to visit . was greeted at the door felt extremely welcomed by the friendly owner . i tried the ed's classic italian it was one of the most satisfyingly delicious sandwiches i've ever had . i'd recommend any everyone to give this place a visit because it is well worth it !
very bad experience . my husband and i ate brunch at le peep in charlotte today , 12 13 10 . it was our first and last visit . online there was a nice menu and what looked like an upscale restaurant . i purchased a groupon certificate so that we at there even though the floors were dirty , many table cloths were ripped , and it was cold . the first thing to arrive was my cappuccino . i looked around for cinnamon , as there was none served with the drink or on the table , i had to walk up to the cashier to obtain some . eventually my husband's order arrived , minus the avocado that was a feature of the omelet . had he been notified upon ordering or shortly thereafter that there was no avocado available , he would have ordered something different . i also had a problem with my crepe . the crepes were only room temperature as were the potatoes . i did not send them back , because it had taken a long time to arrive at our table , and i wasn't going to have my husband wait for me to receive my order and sit there while i ate it with nothing in front of him . the bacon was of poor quality . prior to leaving , my husband used the men's room and the stall closure was broken , hanging down , unusable . that was something anyone who cares for the restroom would have seen . it was all extremely disappointing , and i would never eat there again , and i certainly would not recommend it to anyone . it was really bad .
this place is amazing . we had halwa puri and channe and eggs and it was hella off the hook . my parents said it was the best halwa puri they had ever had . the location is a bit run down but don't let that scare you . highly recommend
i love the concept and offerings of sprouts . food options and produce always seems so fresh . sandwiches at deli are a steal , and fresh boar's head products , and they pack a lot in there . natural bath and body products , prices are not too impressive they are average priced considering the quality and smaller lines but the selection is amazing and gives you plenty to choose from . have some of the best natural lines of lotions and washes . however this particular store needs to step up its game . i've stopped getting the natural nuts or grains b c i've seen bugs in those cases one too many times . i've also seen some flies hanging around the muffin cases too often also . none of these incidents were one time moments , this is a repeat pattern i've noticed . worst here the lines . the long a lines . what a buzz kill . i want healthy fresh veggies that take me 30 seconds to find and 30 minutes to actually purchase . seriously , i think we will all pay a little more to have another clerk available during peak hours . those poor people working there , it just seems so understaffed . i fully support sprouts , its mission , its style , and focus . but there needs to be better service all around . service your store with a few more clerks who can help cash out and keep the cleanliness to a higher level
the difference between a business and a good or great business is not only good service but how they perform when things go wrong . bad things can happen and sometimes they are not any body's fault . sometimes they are . good customer service means that you figure out how to make things right with your customer , when they do , regardless of the fault . and when it is your fault own it , don't blame someone else . las vegas mannequins lacks that skill set . we used las vegas mannequin several times over the course of several years without much incident . in january and again in february they had poor delivery , and totally screwed up our order . they blamed everyone including us , never responded to our disappointment , never contacted us , never did anything to try and make the situation better , or to make sure that we would use them again . they never even apologized . they are in las vegas so maybe you should just consider working with them a crap shoot . you might come up big or go down in flames . either way they don't really care .
still as good as i remember it . the parlor is truly one of the places i miss most about living in phoenix ! we would frequent this spot at least once a month and always took our friends family here when they visited from out of town . i often find myself wishing there was a location here in san diego . hint hint ! the food is exceptional . you can seriously taste the quality and freshness in the ingredients . you cannot go wrong with the funghi pizza if you love mushrooms and truffles . who doesn't , right ? don't forget to add a whole egg to your pizza . it takes an already awesome pizza to a whole 'nother level . the service is still super friendly and efficient . the place itself still has that cool , chill vibe that just welcomes you to hang out and really enjoy the food placed in front of you . great place to gather with friends and have a great time . as long as this place is in business , it will always be on our itinerary whenever we go back to visit az .
got the kale quinoa salad . dramatically under proportioned for a $ 10 salad . it was a good salad with dried blueberries and somewhat under ripened cherry tomatoes , but i feel like the extra taste sensation brought from the yummy bits was overshadowed by the fact that i'm still hungry . for 10 bucks i shouldn't still be hungry . even if it's a salad .
for a buffet , this delighted . we didn't stand in line too long . we paid $ 41 pop . we tried our fill of apps , entrees , desserts , and etc . dessert first ! you'd think it'd be terrible , as it is at most buffets , but the carrot cake was surprisingly delicious and moist . the brownie was also surprisingly good . and the entrees . the meats . how can you go and not try them ? they were okay to good . they had prime rib , rack of lamb , wagyu beef . good but no stars . the lobster mac n cheese was satisfying albeit a bit runny . in sum , if you come in with the right expectations , you will be satisfied . we were hungry , we couldn't get into any of the fancy restaurants nearby they were all booked over the july 4th weekend , and did i mention we were hungry ?
please please bring back the wonderful vanilla ice cream you used to have for your out of this world hot fudge sundaes ! the ice cream you're using now is just too blah and tasteless . otherwise i love going to hillstone ! the food is generally amazing ! go see for yourself .
upbeat and trendy atmosphere ! it's classy during the day and great for bringing my family . at night it's like a club . the waffle fries and grilled vegetables are addicting . shrimp ceviche is refreshing and makes a perfect , light meal . cheese and fruit plate is always fresh and high quality . the cheeseburger is very juicy and i think they put a little butter on the meat . highly recommend this place !
i really like cafe 157 . although the menu is not very adventurous , the food that is served is always very good . the fried pickles . to . die . for . i usually have the salmon and the chef will always cook it medium rare for me . i love him for that ! i will say , the salmon entree used to come with a fried polenta cake but now it's served with just rice . yawn . being half italian and half sicilian , please understand i have to say i am half sicilian or my sicilian mother will flip her lid , i need the fried polenta cake put back on the menu . it was delish ! from the previous reviews , i know this place gets a bad wrap for slow service but i have never had a problem . of course when we dine there , we are usually not in a hurry anyway . our server last night was super attentive and very professional . he even was nice enough to move our party from outside to inside last night without hesitation . it seems the local bees wanted to join us for dinner and my children were not happy with the dinner crashers . cafe 157 use to have dinner and wine pairing events but i haven't seen them advertised lately . these are were great events . for x amount of dollars you get a 3 4 course meal and a different wine with every course . the chef comes out to explain the dish and the sommelier explains his her choice of wine paring . it's a fun event with no more than 20 people . you get to eat good food , drink good wines and meet some new people . what more can you ask for ? i do hope they bring the event back . it was always a good time .
just got my air conditioner serviced here , had a 10 am appointment and was out the door by 10 45 am . it actually came to less than the price quoted . when does that happen . i usually work on my own cars but this is the 2nd time i have used this place both times i was very pleased . in addition val the counter person was extremely personable which helped pass the wait time . yes the free coffee wifi helped too . it was nice to go to a place not be harassed by up charges unwanted items .
i never yelp and literally had to ! i'm in the industry and am completely embarrassed for the owner's of this establishment . a party of 7 and it took 30 min to get a drink ordered . we finally get our drinks and take it upon ourselves to start our dinner service . so sad for this restaurant because we had 3 newbies that did not experience what they should have . we helped ourselves to the salad bar and sat back down at the table . a server came over asked us if we ordered wine wine glasses on table and says to the server as he is bringing 20 min long bottle of wine sorry i'm bored . uhh ? as we are enjoying salad , someone brings us artichoke spinach dip my thought ? i never received a menu to order that in the first place . we wanted rare cuts of meat that never delivered . we had a pregnant woman that was unable to eat their offered items and was rudely forced to order because she would be charged regardless , really ? ! ? awesome hospitality . drinks were forgotten and at the end of the day i would not recommend this place for a night out . super disappointing because it could be so cool . service is disorganized and dissatisfying . save your pennies .
this location is ok . they don't exceed in customer service . there were 3 associates just chatting with each other and coming from a job that focuses on delighting our customers i guess i can hold other businesses to our standards . anyway i needed help and they didn't notice me . fortunately one employee came up to me when i went back to the section i was looking at .
i came here the other day with a group a friends and we had an amazing time ! our waitress was amazing i forgot her name but she was awesome ! . she knew the menu and cocktails very well and had great recommendations . i have a gluten allergy and she helped me change minor things on food items so i would be able to eat them . it's great going somewhere and the staff is knowledgable about gluten , vegan , and other dietary needs ! the food came out at a good pace along with the drinks . the group of us decided to order for apps brussel sprouts , bbq curls , and the poutine . i could eat that poutine every day of my life . for entrees we got tancredi sunday sauce , citrus balsamic salmon , italian sausage bolognese , and the asian salmon patty . let's just say everyones plates were licked clean . for dessert my friends tried the apple fritters and the nutella banana crisps , which again they licked their plates clean . i think this will be a great restaurant in the lakewood community because it brings something different that i haven't seen before since i moved here . i can't wait to go back for their brunch !
i really enjoyed my stay at planet traveler . i liked the vibe and the location , but the best thing was the breakfast . i was in heaven with the range of cereal and bagels . the room i stayed in was all i needed . i liked that the lockers weren't in the room , but as you go out into the hallway . as a morning person i could go in my locker without disturbing anyone . i would stay again for sure .
great service an even better staff very knowledgeable . the setting was very nice along with the decor my food was good an wish i had gotten what my lady ordered but next time . the only thing i would change is the parking lot is set up ass backwards .
wow ! what an improvement ! my air conditioner broke when we have family coming in this weekend . when i called to book an appointment , they were already at capacity for the day . i explained the urgent nature and sure enough they were able to accommodate us within just a couple of hours . they sent over dave , who was pleasant as can be . he was able to get our home cool again . thank you ! thank you ! thank you !
i tried a few places before this , but wink quickly became my go to for a brazilian wax in charlotte . she always does such a great job very thorough , extremely professional , quick , and reasonably priced . the salon is clean and comfortable . appointments are easily made via text message . can't ask for much more than that !
my husband and i recently worked with oscar at superior blinds and he went above and beyond to get our project completed within a very small window of time we were building a home from out of state and were only on site for a short period of time . the product looks fabulous hunter douglas . oscar was professional and friendly and we could not have been happier with him , the company or the outcome . thank you !
love the dim reddish lighting and soft african beats , makes a very warm and inviting atmosphere . definitely byob to pass the waiting time , we were . the first to arrive so it took about 45 minutes to get our food . we ordered 23 mixed veg combo and 14 ye beg tibbs cubes of lean lamb in a delicious perfectly spiced sauce . the injera was freshly made on the spot , soft and just enough sourness it's fermented like sourdough is . a mix of veg is a good start as you get a variety of lovely flavours , lentils , spinach , potato . the lamb was perfectly spicy for us so if you can't take any heat ask the owner if he can tone it down . owner told me that weekends are 25 off so we might be coming again before we leave .
good ramen for 8 $ ! better broth and cheaper prices than umami . but the service was pretty terrible . we'll definitely be back for take out though .
i had the pleasure of meeting catie the bartender a couple days ago ! great service and 2 for 1 happy hour . i had a caesar salad with shrimp . food was good too .
right from the start the commitment to customer service is apparent . gayle was pleasant and professional in setting up the appointment and explaining the process and pricing to me . kevin and chuck came out to the house and kevin took the time to explain how the screens work and available options . pricing seems to be fair and reasonable to me , when compared to taking it to the hardware store . no fuss . no waiting two weeks for the frame to comeback . the screens fit nicely and look good as well . the work was completed in a timely manner and the impact inside the south facing rooms was nearly immediate . shortly after they left , i was on the phone again with gayle making arrangements to have all the remaining windows on the house screened .
the food was good , nothing too outstanding but it wasn't bad . we only had apps . we got calamari , fried pickles and nachos . also got a strawberry watermelon margarita which was way too sweet and syrupy . i had to water it down with some ice water to finish it . it's always a good place to come have fun and play lots of different games . love the fact i can have an alcoholic beverage while playing games lol
rick was nothing less than amazing best customer service follow through and price in town and went to every place from floor and decour to tropical flooring and by the quality of the product and the expediting of delivery hands down the best experience i could've had with my investment my new home . thank you rick continue to do great work and great service here in las vegas
great service from the minute you walk in the door . it is a family business . the food was good . my dad had the special which was ravioli , he said it was great , i had the chicken parm . it was good , i prefer gina's chicken parm . bf had the clams and the mussells he said both were very good . did not have room for desert . next time for sure .
my sister and i love this place ! even though the location seems a little iffy the food and the service is great . try the shredded beef chimichanga . i don't know what they do to their beef , but i love it .
this place is amazing ! the staff are wonderful and very accommodating . i spent the afternoon in the infrared sauna and massage with jacqueline . everything is clean and nicely decorated . definitely going back the next time i am in town !
we called yankee classic flooring to help us refinish our hardwood floors . we had a very badly damaged area in the hallway , and knew that might add to our overall expense and timeline . we were so happy with the job that they did . they had to replace a few boards in the hallway , but you would never know it matches the rest of the house perfectly . tracey is very knowledgeable and helpful about expectations for wood floors , she helped us pick the best finish to minimize other flaws in the old hardwood and it all looks great ! they were upfront about the cost of everything and we found it to be very reasonable for the great work that they did . their team worked very hard and remained on schedule , finishing when they said they would . overall , it has been a great experience working with them .
yueh tung is an average chinese restaurant with a slight hakka flair . it's heavy on flavour , but mostly on salt and chili sauce that somehow isn't spicy . i tried the manchurian chicken and i liked how under the sauce , the chicken was nice and crispy , but i didn't think the sauce tasted particularly great . also had the chili beef , which had a sauce on it that looked different from the manchurian chicken but actually tasted about the same . for lunch , dishes are all around $ 7 and you will definitely not leave hungry , although i didn't leave with any leftovers either . the dishes are almost all served on rice . the service is efficient , but not attentive .
we showed up at with a party of 6 at 630 645 on a friday night . we were told 30 45 minute wait and 10 minutes later were were sitting down . the service was amazing throughout the meal and food was good . the burgers were great . definitely will be back
i'm only giving this place 4 stars because their burgers are expensive , but i guess that's what you pay for quality burgers . their oxtail chilli cheese fries are to die for ! they have a great selection of fries too . very unique burger joint .
every dish we had was great . a group of four of us shared the mango salad , sweet and sour chicken , and a couple appetizer type foods .
walked in not sure what to expect . hubby likes jerk chicken , i've never had it . but with a groupon offer , i said , why the heck not ? we were pleasantly greeted and asked our drink orders . then food we had the ox tails with veggies and plantanes and a order of jerk chicken wings . both good . but that ox tail was so amazing i wanted to lick the dish . you gotta try this place . casual location for some out of this world taste .
came here with my friend and we each had a child . my friend managed to get us a booth . there was a line from the register to the door . not bad for the second day . ordered two combination sandwiches and a vegetarian sandwich . also bought a hot fried pork roll , a pate chaud and 6 sesame red bean balls to go and got two of the free ice coffee drinks . it took them awhile to get our sandwiches ready expected that on the second day but once it was , i really enjoyed the combination . my one suggestion is to spread a little more pate and mayonnaise onto the bread . my pet peeve of the chandler location is that there's never enough pate and mayo spread . sometimes i have to buy more on the side , i wish i didn't since it's already expensive . this new location can use a little more spread as well . brought the veggie sandwich home for my mom . the hot fried pork roll was great and the pate chaud was good except the meat inside was small . overall . be a little generous with preparing your food and you'll likely have more returning patrons .
we came here for dessert after dinner , i ordered the mango mania signature drink and my partner ordered the m m , we also ordered the mango panna cotta , mango pudding and mango sticky rice . the drinks were ok , the signature drink was to full of everything but the juice and the mango sticky rice was just awful , no flavor and bland and the rice was drier then normal , i have had this type of dessert at every thai restaurant in calgary and they know how to make this dessert . the price range is quite expensive for bubble drinks . so , it will put a dent in your wallet .
seriously the best brunch place i have ever been to . too bad i am from the states so i won't be returning as often as i want to . came with a few friends and we ordered the memphis chipotle bbq pulled pork benedict , the charlotte smoked salmon benedict , plt sandwich rosemary focaccia , peameal bacon , lettuce , tomato , garlic aioli , and the heaven on earth french toast , berries , cream cheese , honey , pure maple syrup to share . the food was flavorful and the home fries with their legendary sauce was absolutely delicious . the heaven on earth was something new . the first few bites were good , but the cream cheese became a little overwhelming after that . overall , i was very satisfied with my meal . would definitely be coming back if i was to visit toronto again .
great food and my favorite part was the tortilla soup !
this place is awesome . they have their own beers on tap , which we loved . we tried the lager and the red , and both were great . atmosphere is fun and laid back ! four stars only because our food wasn't amazing . i ordered a burger , and my boyfriend ordered wings , and they were okay , but nothing to rave about .
super clean fresh modern , great service and atmosphere ! come here before it gets too popular ! great deals on sushi and the cutest ceramics for the sake and tea .
was born and raised in ny amongst the delis , so believe me when i say this place is quality . yes , i've had better , but not by much and my standards are pretty darn high . this place makes me feel at home .
adam 444 was very timely and helpful . took his time diagnosing my issue and even helped find other trouble that saved me $ in the future . job took some time as it was a bit cumbersome no fault of his . very satisfied with overall work .
adella is a horrible manager , iland should not be interacting with customers , or representing your brand . we were hosting a birthday party for a few kids , and we were called the day before to confirm that kids wear shoes with laces , and if anyone has long hair , tie it up , or braid it . nothing was mentioned about permission slips , even though we mentioned it was for a birthday party . when we got to the check in desk , she mention we would need those waivers , and at that point was tough , since only 2 parents drove , with multiple kids in each car . how were we supposed to get permission from every parent , in such a short amount of time ? it's bad enough we weren't told up front that we would need waivers , and that they could be done on line , or to print and bring in . it's more about how she handled the situation , when it was pointed out that we were not aware . she looked at us like we were crazy , and that's why i mentioned to her there's got be a better way in the future , when you know there's a birthday party , for handling waivers . all she did was get a very smarmy look on her face and then a very sarcastic ok , thanks . her condescending tone is not appreciated . you need to be aware that this woman is representing your business , and she a single handedly costing you business . your venue is expensive , but when the experience is good , it's worth paying the money . it's not worth spending this kind of money to be treated like this .
my husband and i love this restaurant . we go here once a week . we are originally from southern colorado and there is a restaurant in our home town called 3 margaritas turns out same family as plaza bonita ! we love the burrito colorado , the carnitas , really everything . it's consistently good and fast .
first time coming to umiya and went solely based off of yelp reviews . boy am i glad that i ate here ! service was quick and excellent ! the choices were endless and the food was extremely delicious . set and setting was extremely spacious with medium to loud noise . i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that is or isn't even in the area !
love it here and hate to move out . lived here dor 2 years and no problems with the community great next door neighbors ! all appliances in great conditions . like that the gym is open all day not just bussiness hours !
love this place ! great food and service ! i've been here twice this weekend . there omelets and burgers with garlic fries are a must !
great place when i went here it was great and i wish we come here again 5 star but too much sexy picture for kids like me what the heck
i had the chicken piccata and my husband had the veal piccata , both recommended by our server , tana . the food was amazing , our server was amazing and the ambience was amazing . there was a couple singing a blend of jazz and pop . they are absolutely fantastic ! we had a really wonderful evening ! the manager came by to find out how we were doing . we could not have had a better experience ! we will definitely be back .
we just moved into the neighborhood and craving some good mexican food . the green chili beef burro was awesome ! we can't wait to go back for more . the owners are super nice people that care about their food and customers experience . if your in the area you need to try this place .
love napoli ! the wings , fries , philly steaks and pizza never disappoint ! it is our go to . especially our late night cravings . great customer service ! the one lady gave my baby girls juice while we waited for take out . super super sweet !
this place is seriously the best ! while on vacation in vegas , i was in need of a cut and went to this place based on the reviews . while i did wait about 1 . 5 hours , it was relaxing and well worth it . i wanted something new and the barber recommended a cut , which i have consistently received compliments on . oh , and the pomade they used , suavecito is my new best friend . i just wish that they had it available in travel size for planes . so here is the big thing , i like them so much i will be flying back to get my haircut next month . yes , i live in washington , dc on the other side of the continent , but i can put up with crappy service from spirit air to get exceptional customer service and the best cut at this place .
so happy we found this delightful little dim some spot . it's in the doubletree hotel upstairs a little small but that made it all the better . they had a special dim sum lunch by one get second 50 off so my friend and i took advantage of that . check out the pictures the food was delicious definitely worth going , he said the last time he was there was 15 years ago which shows they been around for a while and he explained how much better the food was on this visit . definitely worth the visit .
beautiful setting horrible food . ordered the chips and salsa the salsa had gone to vinegar disgusting . i have tried this place 6 times in 18 months and have sent back 3 meals . interestingly they want to charge you $ 7 to add guacamole totally afraid to even try
we arrived at about 5pm on a recent saturday . felt as if no a c was on , only one another party of four in the restaurant and they wanted to seat us next to the door so we could get blasted by the 112 degree temps each time the door opened . we requested to be seated elsewhere so they seated us right in front of the kitchen . what i did not like was the entire restaurant staff standing together in such a small space 4 feet from our table the entire meal . food was mediocre at best with little flavor . too many italian restaurants to explore that are not in a strip mall and offer more room and better food . go to vito's much better
there is nothing here , not the food , not the service , not the ambiance , that's worth the inexplicable and inexcusable wait for food to be delivered when the place is half empty to begin with . i'm done .
we had been here on one previous occasion just for drinks which was late on a saturday night and we wanted to make sure we came back to try the food . we went last night friday night at 6 30 . i decided to make a reservation just in case it was busy . when i called to make the reservation it appeared that the girl that answered the phone might have been new as she had to ask if she could take a reservation . she seemed rushed and a little on the short side . when we arrived there were 3 girls at the hostess station and the place was pretty busy . we were seated right away at a table nearest the line of traffic from the kitchen and the bar . there are quite a few people working during this time so it was quite distracting to have constant foot traffic by bussers , wait staff , bar patrons and hostesses . we waited at least 10 minutes before we finally got a waitress . ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer . he was hoping for better choices but was okay with it . no local beers . i ordered the colossal shrimp quinou and my husband got the filet special with fingerling potatoes . i couldn't eat the quinou as my first bite appeared crunchy and undercooked . i just left that alone as i didn't care for the flavor at all . the shrimp was very tasty and a good size shrimp . my husband enjoyed his filet . overall . our experience was just okay unfortunately . i am thinking if we were seated somewhere a bit more out of the line of traffic it would have been a nicer experience . we were right next to her bar as well and there was a guy standing right behind my husband visiting with a few patrons at the bar . next time we'll either ask to be seated outside or in a less busy location . i would like to try a few other items on the menu so we will be coming back and hopefully for a better experience .
this place is fabulous . it's golf2k . imagine going to a lounge with music , great food , and alcohol and the plus is hitting golf balls as far as you can . the prices on drinks are kinda expensive but this is vegas . i had a blast , the most fun i ever had going to a driving range . the cool part is it's not just a regular driving range . there are multiple games you can choose from to keep it competitive and interesting . i would definitely come back .
first off a place that has homemade salsas that are fabulous ! tacos are great . but i think the green chili burger is one of the best in the state ! dip the fries in the chipolte salsa add a mexican coke and call me one happy mofo ! did i tell you how nice the whole crew is ?
hello mike , i called guardsman to make an appointment and they told me they will call back with a technician . an individual contractor from furniture pro was send from walkers to fix our switch box for the sofa and it's been working good . i called you and left you a voicemail this afternoon to update you and since you told me to call after everything is settle . call me when you get a chance . thank you .
this is a great gelato shop . they have a chocolate orange , oreo , and chocolate coffee gelato that are all delicious . there are also about 20 other flavours i have not tried . there is limited seating inside , and the place is a bit sterile . they also do not take credit cards , which is not the worst thing in the world , but would be nice . hopefully they can make a go of it here . i am glad that they have opened in the junction .
this is not a pizza joint . it's an indian restaurant that attempts to serve pizza . and their food and prices are nothing to get excited about at allllllll .
triple seven used to be a great microbrewery been going to triple 7 for the last 10 years it was one of my favorite bars in las vegas the high roller used to be an awesome beer now the high roller is bitter and cloudy . the atmosphere and dining are great . if triple 777 brewmaster would go back to the original award winning formula for beer this would be a 5 star bar .
wanted a nice night , it's a hit or miss place . we were so underwhelmed . messy presentation , barely warm food . 2nd visit . off the list , sad we tried .
after two negative experiences , i wanted to give this location another chance , only to be severely disappointed once again . upon walking into the door , i am greeted if you can call it that with a , what's the last name . the girl behind the counter obviously could care less about customer service since she gave less than none . not even a hint of a smile . the girl looked as if she were going over everything else she would rather be doing in her head . i felt not only unwelcome , but disrespected as a paying customer . i came with a friend who had never done a spray tan before , and i let the girl explain to her how to do it . i myself have worked in a tanning salon for over 5 years , and every direction that the girl gave my friend was 100 wrong . to keep my friend from having her spray tan ruined , i explained the correct way for her to apply barrier cream , pose , etc . when it came my turn for the spray tan , i stepped into the booth onto the metal plate and was pracitcally standing in a puddle a problem i had had before . i went up to the front and asked very politely , if she could please wipe down the plate because it was still very wet . not only did the girl roll her eyes at me , but she did not entirely wipe the plate . i was still standing in wetness during my spray . on top of everything else , i ended up having water drip on me from the ceiling of the booth due to the fact that the machine had not been properly wiped down after sanitization . any vet spray tanner will know how detrimental having water drip on you during a spray tan can be . it goes without saying that i will not be returning to this location any more , and neither will my friend . if any managers are reading this and are interested to know who the girl was that was working , i visited on 10 7 12 at 6 pm at the tempe location .
skip emeril's there is much better food for less money it is not new orleans style the gumbo which is supposed to be table stakes for a place with new orleans in the name was overseasoned heavily with only 1 thing it was full of pepper . grossly so , did you spill it in there ? and then my second appetizer came out , the scallop lobster ravioli was waaaay too salty . i did not pour their black sauce over it either , but i tried a drop of it on a spoon first the waiter warned me that sauce was salty so i did not use it the dish was too salty to eat even without this sauce on it , would have rendered it uneatable if i poured that on it . so my review is . could you guys in the kitchen try some other spices other than being lazy with salt and pepper ? to me , it's just lazy to use cheap spices instead of spending the right time to get the other flavors to come thru . really ! because those two without cayenne , garlic , onion , or any of the other awesome nola seasonings leave me with a very bad experience . 1 star
one of my favorite places in town ! good for sushi lives and non sushi lovers alike . wonderful raw and non raw options . the tempura , the hanger steak , and the sushi are excellent .
on saturday night , my girlfriends and i decided that sushi was going to be the meal of choice before a night out on the town . we we're painfully aware of our sushi rut and were very excited to try something new especially a place that has food happy hour prices from 5 cl we're all struggling students just graduated and enjoy amazing food , we don't always have the pockets to fund our eating habits . we arrived around 9ish and we're graciously welcomed and seated in the lounge . i enjoyed to decor it was sleek , sexy and modern . i would not recommend saki bombing there , you have to buy the saki and beer separate . our waitress was nice and meant well , but things just took that extra 5 minutes too long and it wasn't very crowded . since we were going out to scottsdale afterwards we ate light . we tried the salmon avocado roll , hamachi serrano chili roll , edamame , spicy salmon roll and the kobe burgers . the sushi was extremely fresh and hamachi serrano chili roll really stood out , it had just enough kick . the kobe burgers we're just the right size and full of flavor . i enjoyed the experience but wouldn't recommend it for that pre sushi spot before going out on the town which i don't think is what roka is going for anyways .
it took 20 minutes to get our food and it wasn't even busy . avoid this location . why do bojangles virtually everywhere struggle in the exact same way .
discovered this neighbourhood gem tonight . food was great portions were very generous . service was friendly . the restaurant was larger then i expected and full ! will definitely be going back . !
i've had consistently good experiences here for over a decade . all big box music stores are slow in regard to getting your transaction completed in a timely fashion . it seems like they use the same software as the airlines . you know , they type furiously for 5 minutes only to ring up a set of strings after calling over a coworker to check a code entry . staff and management both have been helpful whether i knew what i was talking about or not or whether i was buying or just looking . i would disagree with murray's review prices are competitive kids really don't want some old rusty hagstrom you found in a smelly pawn shop . also , don't sell your gear to any store , sell it to a musician .
we come here almost every time we make a trip to phoenix . it is the hands down freshest sushi in arizona ! we always order the shrimp tempura roll and arizona roll . it is a smaller venue but definitely worth the wait when you have to .
have only come a few times as i just started working in the area , the pastries they serve are delicious . but most of all the owners couldn't be happier or friendlier . its refreshing walking in here in the morning .
haven't been here in at least 10 years things haven't changed much food is okay for a big change nothing special like the fact that they have different options for the sides instead of just rice and beans i got the fajitas which are way too fatty not very flavorful should have got something with their baja sauce witch is what my sob had next time but thus place is better then garcia's
there's a darn good reason everyone that deals with this company rates them a 5 star or better , if yelp allowed it ! . it takes just one call and conversation with tracy or david to put you at ease to their competence and genuine caring for the customer . that's just the start . their follow through and follow up are as much as one wants in dealing with any business or service . i first used them to treat for termites in december and they were very thorough and even though they were just slightly higher than my lowest bid i didn't hesitate in using them because of how tracy handled all my questions and concerns . they were 1st rate all around ! recently , i was selling my home and set to close in 1 week . the inspection report came back as evidence of termite activity no duh , it was just treated 5 mos ago . i called tracy and explained the situation and just a little while later david called and told me he would have somebody out the next day to retreat areas i told him it was not necessary since i had not seen any recent activity since their initial treatment . josh very able was out the very next day right on time and re treated a couple of areas . within the hour of him returning to the office david filled out the paperwork i needed to send to the lender so my house was able to close on time . they are the best !
my no chip manicure started chipping literally the next day and i was only in town for the weekend so i can't have it fixed . absolutely not worth $ 28 .
worst jack in the box ever ! so much for being 24 7 . there was 1 car at the window and about 2 in front of me . i waited for about 30 mins and still was in the same spot . i ended up leavening . not very happy and still hungry .
handling burgers like a boss . you know you'll get through a drive thru lane that's wrapped around a building when they have a team of folks taking your order outside . this is a usual sighting at most in n outs . robots i tell you . robots ! decided to drive through and we were in an out pun intended in less than five minutes . we had about ten cars ahead of us so i found this incredibly impressive . my classic order is the double double , animal style . those grilled onions are money . i'm not a fan of their fries but this visit i snuck a few from my buddy and they kinda hit the spot ! the burger was juicy and stayed together until the last bite . this was a full 5 star experience but i'm left with one question . why did i forget to order a milkshake ? !
went in for the $ 34 new patient special . been going to the dentist every 6 months my whole life . never had any issues . after the dental exam they said it would be $ 350 for a deep clean . i walked out and booked an appointment at a different dentistry . had my teeth perfectly cleaned for under $ 100 . told the dentist about perfect teeth and he confirmed that they were trying to rip me off . found out the next day that the exact same thing had happened to my mother in law at perfect teeth . they tried to charger her hundreds of dollars , she walked out and got her teeth cleaned somewhere else .
we were so excited to try mercadito . the menu sounded great and it's hard to find good fresh mexican food . we walked in and asked for a sugar free tea . the have no sugar free drinks except diet pepsi . the waitress suggested water . next we ordered the shrimp ceviche . when it arrived we asked for pepper . we were told they don't have salt or pepper . took one bite of the overpriced ceviche and spit it out . it was tiny , overpriced , and doused in some sweet red sauce that tasted like sugar water . we told our waitress we couldn't eat there and walked out . huge disappointment , horrible food , and the service was pretty bad too . go to the yardhouse and you will never be disappointed .
it was a great experience , the food and service was amazing . thank u david a . we definitely gone come back soon .
good thing i only paid 8 bucks for this buffet . for the same price you should go to the santa fe station buffet . way better ! the mexican fare is better here though still a smaller selection than santa fe . asian is not good here . dessert bar very lacking i don't think the desserts are even made here since i can see a bunch of bakery boxes and aluminum pie tins around . definitely going back to santa fe for the buffet from now on .
worst nail salon in the whole universe . this place is dirty , and people there are so rude . people should never go there . garbage place .
i absolutely love stancatos ! the staff is so friendly and accommodating . the food is just to die for . i order here often from the pronto menu attend many of their special buffets for the holidays . i'm always satisfied and i can't get enough ! i wish i could pick a favorite . from the mussels to the meatballs , to the alfredo sauce and of course the ciabatta garlic rolls ! definitely recommend ! also they have an absolutely amazing italian buffet every sunday as well as during the week . and you can always order any or those items from their menu any day of the week . you can either dine in or order out ! love love love stancatos !
rob is hands down the best carpet cleaning service i have ever dealt with . i have gotten my carpets cleaned at least five times over the last 7 years . the price actually came out cheaper then he quoted me which was already reasonable . he was at my house for three hours cleaning tile and carpet until 9 00pm at night . he truly takes pride in his work . he even gave me a spot remover and pet odor remover as a parting gift . if you do not use this company , you are making a big mistake .
amy is the best ! customer service beyond expectations ! best trophy shop in the nw of las vegas !
this is not a family medical facility . more like an urgent care facility at best . appointments are always late , you can only discuss one issue per visit and only allowed 10 minutes ! although you have a primary care person , there is no relationship what so ever with that person . it always feels like your visit is taking staff away from there free time
i used ameriserv for two project one for client and another for a personal service . the client service was perfect and had no issue . the personal a technician showed up and there was a miscommunication on who would be installing the outlet for the door opener . i would have scheduled that through an electrician had i known they couldn't do it . i was under the impression they were able to do it . so i'm now having to arrange an electrician around the holidays to put the outlet in . so far i've had no luck in doing so . lesson learned always get an itemized list of services on the invoice you've paid for in advance .
the service was great , they were very helpful with my large order for a production shoot . food was really good , i'd go back more often if it was closer to where i lived worked .
last weekend we were in vegas celebrating my twin cousins birthdays and decided to go off the stip for some tacos at yayo tacos that we saw on diners drive ins and dives . we got there super early to avoid a crowd and were the first people seated . after reviewing the menu we decided to all get the taco special which included four tacos and two sides for $ 10 . out of the tacos chosen the shanghai was definitely was the best . the tacos and the sides were large are very filling . overall , the food and services was great ! definitely worth a 6 minute trip off the strip and it was nice to get out a the chaos we all experience at some point in vegas
i ordered the white , a canolli , and the bruschetta bread . the pizza was awesome , flavors were great , just be prepared with mints because there is plenty of fresh garlic . the canolli was creamy and the bruschetta bread was amazing ! i would definitely order from this place again if i could .
i have taken several classes at rio and i believe your experience is what you make of it . i have found the instructors to be professional and very interactive . after a long day of work it is nice to be able to go home , wind down , and put on comfy clothes to study at my pace . also , i am not having to wait for the students that are not getting it always behind . i do enjoy on campus classes too , but rio really gives me a better quality of life as far as free time , no commute , and one on one attention from the instructors .
overpriced shawarma plate and doesn't even taste good . it came out with just chicken and rice ? where's all the normal veggies , had to pay 3 dollars more for veggies came up to 18 . everything else was good tho . would i come back no .
everything was prepared perfectly . everything was delicious . service was flawless . a rare 10 10 at the high end . only problem could be that they don't change the fundamentals of their menu often enough . if they changed their menu more often i'd go there more . or if they made it clearer what the specials would be . everything is great , but i'd love to see more variety .
ugh . nothing about our experience two weeks ago was good . the restaurant was cold . food gross . service blah .
we went here tonight and loved it . we shared the platter 2 people . 3 ribs , brisket , 4 chicken wings , mac 5 cheese and fries . you can pick from a list of options for the platter . i expected more food especially the ribs but it was filling . the mac 5 cheese was served piping hot , which i love . i hate getting cold food . there are sauces on the table for your wings or other food . we were seated outside which was really nice . tables were cool . bathrooms are small . our server was a sweetheart . food came quickly . i'd go back , but i'd like to try the grilled cheese or poutine . food platter $ 30 , extra side of fries $ 5 , 2 beers $ 16 . grand total of $ 57 with tax .
i had my wedding reception at pine ridge on july 1 , 2011 . i was beyond pleased with their services ! the food and service was outstanding . the venue is gorgeous ! they made our reception ! i would highly recommend pine ridge to anyone looking to have an elegant and memorable reception .
best greek place around durham , even better than most places in toronto . tzatziki is homemade and i always try to get extra to use at home . fast and friendly service , can't beat this place
love this meal service . i've tried several in the past and this really suits my needs . can't believe these can taste so good from the microwave . delivers with taste , nutrition as well as portion control . and you seriously can not beat the convenience . yah , i've read reviews complaining about the price tag but 12 meals with free shipping that you don't have to cook or mess with for $ 107 ? come on guys , you pay for the luxury of not having to order food or meal prep and go to the grocery store . my job is demanding and some days i don't even get but maybe a few minutes to eat . this service is wonderful . the only thing that i think would make it better is if the menu would change a bit more or had a larger expansion of choices . i don't really mess with the breakfasts as i find they are a bit bland . also love the suggestions on the sleeves for those who appreciate a bit more spice or flare to the dish .
the food was okay . the metal shard that i found in my takeout noodles ruined any good benefits though . especially since i emailed them to let them know , and didn't hear anything back .
i have been going to this place for over 2 years . about 2 years ago they started this plan to charge people $ 25 if u were a no show , but not as long as u called before ur appointment . that i can understand , to just not show up without a call from anyone is disrespectful . however when u call cause u have a medical emergency or a car accident , or a car emergency now they want to charge u $ 50 regardless , if u have proof or not . i hate this clinic on horizon ridge ! i liked the one on post rd and once it closed this whole place went to shit ! i have had enough . something has to be done . it's wrong to treat people that ask for help like druggie's or , dig into our pockets because of emergency . guess what they happen . remember ms . kim and ur rude attitude , karma is a bitch . what goes around comes around . i may not see it but it happens . i hate this place . love my doctors . sad that we r forces to find a new place to go cause the front office staff sucks !
its no secret that the mall has been renovated and is aesthetically pleasing ! service is usually great when i do go to any of the stores . im a repeat customer at stores like gnc guess bombay kamdorbo walmart cinnabon footlocker best buy hair kraze one major problem is the lack of stylish and trendy stores for my taste . i don't mean expensive either . i mean the stores at this mall are some what generic and are at all the other shopping malls . while the other malls have more . markville lacks stores with unique clothing appareal for that reason i only go to markville for a hand full of items which i purchase on a monthly basis or less often . its been expanding and replacing tenants which is a good strategy to cater to a younger crowd . it is just as safe as any other mall i believe . i'd like to see some stores in particular but rather not list them ! take care !
i love the french vanilla and this crew is really good in making the one that exactly i want !
this is the first time we have visited this establishment . we will for sure never be back . when we pulled into the drive through the girl that greeted us was friendly and helpful . we pulled forward and the guy that sprays off your car was too busy horse playing with the one of the oil change guys . every car wash removes our antennas as a professional courtesy . if the guy was not playing perhaps this would have happened . their equipment broke our antenna clean off our van . the manager came over to look at our car and he did not even acknowledge our presence . a simple apology would have been appreciated . they did a horrible job on our van . we purchased the vip package for 19 . 99 which is way over priced for what you receive . our car sat in the sun for 10 minutes before anyone even touched our car . our van has water spots and it looks like they did not even wipe down the interior or clean the windows . the only thing it appears they did was vacuum and dress the tires . our experience and lack of pride in the kids that work there will never bring us back .
best place to get a cut . there attention to detail is out of this world . loved everything about this shop . the atmosphere , the pool table , the darts and the barbers are just hilarious . wouldn't go anywhere else . thanks sin city .
i bought a groupon for this restaurant and saved it for a special meal . decided to use it this evening to treat my son at the end of his christmas break . was close to home and i was hoping for some delicious seafood . my family loves seafood and we eat a lot of it . the place is a hole in the wall but we were warmly greeted and well taken care of . the guy's wanted calamari which i didn't want to order mostly because it was $ 11 . 99 but i caved unfortunately . it was a small amount of overly breaded fried scraps . the taste wasn't too bad for crunchy scraps . the owner made the mistake of asking us how it was . silence fell over the table me averting my eyes for a full minute then my husband just let it rip . honestly this is the worst calamari i ever ate . he tried to make it up by bringing us a small order of fried oysters . the flavor was okay but it was another basket of overly fried seafood . i wanted to suggest some places he could visit to see what calamari should look and taste like . 2 ice tea's $ 4 . 98 thank goodness the hubby drank water . my son had fried oysters , hush puppies and onion rings . more overly fried food but he liked it $ 14 . 99 . pasta alfredo $ 14 . 99 for the hubby and this tasted pretty good with lots of shrimp but not worth the price . i had the crab cake just 1 $ 16 . 99 . there wasn't a lot of filler in it but it just didn't taste like the price . i was expecting succulent juicy crab and it was pretty dry and blah . hubby got a side of onion rings $ 2 . 99 . our bill was over $ 91 . 00 before the $ 25 . oo groupon . for this kind of money we could have eaten at a really nice restaurant with delicious food . i recommend if you have this kind of money to spend go somewhere else . we will definitely not go back . three stars because the service was great .
i have to say , i'm quite disappointed by my experience with this location . i frequent aloha kitchen on charleston and lamb with my family and i absolutely love their service , the food is fabulous and the mood is light ! today , i tried this location to order my regular chicken teriyaki bowl and a side of mac salad . i paid $ 1 . 99 for what ended up being a tea spoon of mac salad , which i asked for them to fix in addition to a rather dry chicken bowl . i'll never return to this location . i'll stick with charleston and lamb !
best thai restaurant i've ever been to ! better than anything i've ever had all over the west coast . that's seriously saying a lot given i'm from ca . great flavors , perfect spice level i usually get 8 10 10 most restaurant but my friend wanted only 5 10 . even then it was just perfect . can't explain , generous portions green curry mango with tofu had so many veggies . my fav ! , nicely decorated , great ambiance , wonderful staff and all those authentic dishes . can't wait to come back . posted some pic , too .
i was really excited to try this place , but was slightly disappointed by my meal of perch tacos . they were dry , lacked sauce , and were served on cold tortillas . i would give the tacos 2 stars , but i also realize that i went to a fish and chips place and got tacos , so i'll also take into consideration that i should have tried the fish and chips instead . my boyfriend thought his thai chili chicken tacos were four star worthy . the only thing here that i would really recommend was the mac n cheese . it was delightful . sometimes you get bland sauce and overcooked noodles , but this was not the case this time . the sauce was pretty special . it was creamy and very flavorful . i had to physically move the cup it came in , so i would not eat my boyfriends half accidentally . i would go back just for the mac n cheese . i might even be interested in trying the fish and chips . oh , also , the boxy tots seem to just be mashed potatoes dropped into a fryer . they were herb seasoned and pretty unique .
max is the local maximum at this hyatt's restaurant bar in phoenix . by definition , he presents the value of a function at a certain place or domain which is greater than or equal to the values at all other points in downtown phoenix . his recommendation of bar favorites including the grilled chicken beast with avocado was the bomb . he works his domain well thumbs up !
oh you fancy huh ! oh you fancy huh ! las vegas you so crazzzay ! see you again soon !
this is my first review , and usually i just read them , but i just have to review this business ! i researched this on yelp , cuz i have never let anyone touch my brows ! so , after reading many reviews and narrowing it down , i decided to be brave and try it . i am so glad i did ! i cannot stop looking at my new brows ! they are fabulous and i got the threading and tinting done , and she threaded my stache i am thrilled with the work and staff there . very chill place and great vibe ! the women in there are sweet , helpful and above all knowledgeable ! she shaped and tinted me perfectly ! i will be theirs for life now ! they are awesome ! they also offer waxing and laser hair removal which i am going to try next i cannot thank you enough marci sp ? ! she is quick , painless and fabulous ! not to mention she has fabulous brows and is cute as a button and sweet ! thanks fellow yelpers , and hopefully my very first review helps someone like myself in the future
location offered me compensation for the negative service . location was extremely depleted of rental cars during hurricane aftermath . i am hoping that was the reason 4 individuals had a 45 minute wait for scheduled rental cars .
hexx is one of the few 24 hour dining establishments within the paris hotel . previously i never dined with them but i was a bit hungry upon my return from a show i ordered around 12am so i decided to give it a try . i was dining solo and was directed to sit at the bar . once i placed my order it took a while for the food to get out so i changed my order for takeout . service was somewhat efficient however not very warm or inviting . the lady ringing me up said she was unable to charge my room as there were too many people with my name and that i did not come up under my room number . although it was not a terrible inconvenience i found it a bit open to doubt as i made 2 charges to my room within the same hour prior to placing my order with no issue . the portion size of the gnocchi pomodoro was fairly small and the creamed corn seemed more like a liquid with bits of lobster . i do understand that it was late night dining and thus my rubric should be adjusted . however after arriving to my room and ascertaining what i received for roughly $ 60 including tax tip , i did not feel fairly satisfied with the meal . i feel if i were to actually dine in i might have a better opinion so i will do a follow up on my next trip .
terrible service . after they were 40 minutes late for my appointment , they told me i would be after an appointment that had just started .
i used to work with mr shea . i decided to go to his barber shop after cutting my own hair for the past 20 years or so . i wanted a new bald fade . i previously called earlier in the week to make an appointment on saturday . tank ended up cutting my hair . excellent job ! will be going back every two weeks !
i decided to order my burger to go because i wanted to try it but didn't want to sit down at the place by myself . i just had the normal bachi burger which is okay , but i feel that it's not worth the price . i do want to try a different kind of burger if i ever visit this place again though . i also had the oxtail fries which sounded amazing but it ended being a little too sweet for my taste . they give you a large portion of it and it was nice of the server to give me a cup of the sauce so the fries weren't soggy . the server that helped me was nice to keep me updated as i was waiting for my food .
the gym is first class and ran very well by knowledgeable and friendly coaches . i felt immediately welcome and part of the crossfit community . i'll continue to come here when i'm in phoenix .
i'm not usually in university area these days so on a recent return i was surprised to find that sushi 101 is now a cheesily named love sushi . whatevs , let's check it out . quality has come down from what bit sushi 101 had back in the day . there's definitely a lot of selection , though some parts of the menu can be confusing . the raw fish isn't top quality stuff and i've had better for similar prices . i didn't find their menu to be particularly cheap either , unlike some other reviews . as i said though , lots of selection . they seem to know their stuff when it comes to real japanese food . it's not all just hibachi chicken and rice . there's gyouza , edamame , lots of sake options , real sushi and sashimi as close as you can get here , chicken katsu style and the various noodles . our server was super polite and friendly , smiling the entire time . however , it seemed like he was the only person running the tables and he was a bit flustered with 4 5 tables seated . the sushi chef was also friendly , though we didn't sit at the bar . in the end though , it's not a place i would specifically single out for a return visit .
if you're into flavor with a slight asian twist then this place is a must ! , their oxtail chili cheese fries are a delicious mixture of sweet and chili spice along with their signature banh mi burger that infuses lemongrass , pork pate and fresh herbs , . oh those pork belly steam buns are outrageously awesome !
this is my favorite place in town , the food is great specially the steak and chicken madeira is so great , it is juicy and perfectly cooked . our waiter , iisaiah gonzalez , is awesome he is friendly and helpful he is the best .
we had an emergency and chris came out and did a great job . robins is the only plumbing company i would call . they are honest and reliable .
when our air conditioner stopped working in the middle of an az heat wave 113 degrees , we retreated to his hotel , since it was close to our tempe home . the morning after our first night there , my husband's car battery was dead . i want to give high praise to the night clerk , frank , who came to my husband's aid . he took all the time needed to get the car in position to use jumper cables , and stayed with the task until he was sure the car was running . he provided service with a capital s . and we want to publicly thank him for going above beyond to help . the hotel itself provided a very convenient room , since we brought our dog . we were on the first floor , steps away from an exit door and could easily get outside for dog walks . as in other comfort inns where we have stayed , they provided a complete offering of hot and cold breakfast items , and our room had the usual cable tv , frig , microwave , coffee machine , and hair dryer . we will certainly spend our time here if we ever have another emergency or maybe just take a few days for a staycation . cathy radziemski joe delibero
i called gino in a pinch needing a last minute handyman to help hang lighting . he was very professional and on time . something that is hard to find . he was very personable and knowledgeable . i would definitely recommend cracker jacks handyman . they are on time , knowledgeable , clean and offer great customer service .
great for a quick chinese food stop ! prices are more than reasonable for the value and quantity ! really enjoyed my baked bolognese and cheese for $ 8 . 50 , came with a drink and chinese pear soup . also a more equal ratio of beef and noodles than other places at hwy 7 and kennedy
a beautiful new space , with tons of light . eclectic selection of books too . friendly staff . the only downside was as i was browsing i could hear the screams and laughter from the loud group of women drinking at crust downstairs . not exactly a quiet environment to browse .
omg car wash got to get it done what a necessity to be driving in a nice clean car , sparkling like a star in the sky at night ! we all hate the dreaded thought about taking our car to the car wash , but we love it when its done ! well , the car wash at chevron get n go , is actually easy , convenient , don't even have to get out of the car , and makes you happy when its done . been there a few times ! its not like most car washes , where you just drive through , it is actually manned with 2 3 guys that at the beginning clean your car off with soft brushes before it even starts the drive through with some more delicate brushes as they whisper in the wind kinda like 50 hands washing your car at the same time . makes for a 100 cleaner car . when driving through the car wash , i put on some old 70's music and totally enjoy the ride like i'm in the movies grease . oops , your right , i'm aging myself . lol ! when you are done going through the washer part of the car wash , you then pull out and stop at a designated spot and the guys dry off those running water spots we always have . so cool ! so complete ! then stop off at the do it yourself vacuums and hit the inside . the prices are very very reasonable for a high class service , the staff is very professional , the vacuums are awesome , and i totally recommend a drive through of this car wash ! great job guys ! god speed ! jake out for now !
have eaten here several times and the food is always great . get the blue cheese salad if you like blue cheese something to eat for everyone
great food . great music . great service . loved the fish n' chips plenty for 2 . wing appetizer good and so was shepherd's pie . the band had my feet stomping and head bopping . we ate there free compliments of a voucher redeemed through myvegas , but i'd definitely have no issue paying my hard earned $ for this place .
what a perfect spot to sit comfotably , eat amazing nachos , and talk with our wonderful waiter rodney . im hoping that was his name , he was very good to us . it was our first visit to the palace . first time to the pub . thanks for the memories .
writing this review based on a sandwich ! i haven't even tried the pizza yet . this place is located down the street from my work so i went to check it out . i walked in thinking i was going to get the pizza , but when i looked up at the menu , i saw a sandwich called the darrin . i don't remember everything on it , but it had applewood smoked chicken , pears , carrots , and some exotic cheeses all on a pizza crust foccacia style bread . i thought it read delicious so i ordered it . went over and sat by the window in the sun . noticed a tv with remote to my left . also , there were toys for kids . let me tell you this sandwich is amazing . probably the most unique sandwich i've had . the bread first of all is delicious , but then you get the sweet taste of the pears balanced with the old time vintage flavors of the cheese . every bite is a bit different . and to top it off , . the guy , darrin was cool as shit . he did tell me that the sandwich is only going to be around for about one more week tho , since he feels it is time to change up the menu . i'm excited to see what masterpiece will replace this badass sammich . go and get one right now ! . let me know what you think ! this place is one of the few places that has surprised me since being in vegas . no idea such good food at this unassuming location .
dr . sharma is the best doctor i have ever seen . i found him several years ago on yelp , and it's past time for me to review his office . health issues are emotionally draining , but having such a good primary care doctor makes it easier . dr . sharma is incredibly compassionate and has always taken time to listen to my concerns . i have never had another medical professional as invested in my overall health . he is thorough , no matter the issue , and recommended me to other outstanding specialists when i had some pretty urgent health concerns . i didn't know so many great doctors even existed in vegas ! his staff is welcoming and kind , and they have always gotten me in the day i called for an appointment . i'm so sad he doesn't take my new insurance , but i highly , highly recommend him to all my family and friends .
after drinking all day and hanging out in caesar's , we needed something to eat that we didn't have to wait long ! our friends had stopped by earlier in the day and had the chili and said it was awesome , so we stopped in ! i ordered the burger in a bowl with a turkey burger instead of beef ! my food was good ! i devoured it ! no complaints about the food ! but the service was just ok ! we were in the middle of a shift change and were given our check only minutes after getting our food ! one of my companions didn't like this very much ! neither did i , but it is what it is ! but overall , it was just ok ! located right in front of the pussy cat doll's pop up casino ! it was alright ! nothing to write home about !
awesome food . kids eat free tuesday's and they get a balloon artist to create a balloon of their choice . it's the best time for family time !
celebrated my birthday here . everything was just ok . waitress was flat and abrupt , just on the border of being rude . she asked to take my plate when i was still eating from it and had a good amount of food left . she reached across us instead saying excuse me or handing things . food was marginal . the best part was the roll and salad . the steak was tough , dry , and lacked flavor aside from char . the mashed potatoes had a weird pepper masked something flavor . the sweet tea was not black tea with real sugar and again had some artificial taste to it . pricing was high considering the quality of the food and they don't advertise their prices which goes to tell you they must agree . ambiance was subpar as well and did not feel intimate in the least . if anything i felt like we were on display for everyone in the middle of everything . there was also no waiting area in the front so you're immediately blocking the entrance when you walk in and are waiting for a table .
portion size is pretty big ! i can only eat half of the breakfast burrito i order , their bacon and steak cheese is great . staff are always nice . continue to go back .
check your food people are human this place is no exception but seems to happen more often here 10 pcs nugget only get 8 if you get the buttermilk strips 10 pcs yum but hell only 9 in the box and only 6 edible due over cooking it to a hard flat jaw breaker . also if you want a custom order like no sliver onions on a cheese burgers well your sol i ordered three that way and got one with out onions , two with onions and one had no cheese and the other had no pickel or ketchup so please chech your food because half or more may be incorrect and will be chucked in trash by you or them if you correct it to how you ordered your food .
been going here for years and the corned beef is the best around ! nobody comes close
bacon jam ! whaaaat ? ! i had the not yo mama's grilled cheese , brisket and bacon jam ! far out ! my grandson had the classic burger smothered with mac and cheese and bacon jam ! when asked what kind of food we'd call it . he said can't get much more american than bacon jam ! great food and great service .
is duckee the world's worst restaurant ? no . should you eat there ? definitely not . overpriced mediocre food . phayao thai on yonge is waaaay better at half the price ! yet another painfully average restaurant for mid town to .
i'm a nerd so i decided to check this place out . there for is part goth , part board game , neon lights . velvet drapery kinda thing . it is kitschy and worth 1 visit but the food itself is very mediocre . i tried to order the optimus prime rib dinner for $ 28 and was told no prime rib . i switched to striploin steak instead . wanted butter with my baked potatoes and it came with no butter . green beans were bland and cold , and meat was barely lukewarm . you have to pay $ 4 hour for street parking too . its not great value for money . service is ok but i would not come back . i can pay the same price to eat somewhere better , especially in downtown toronto . the rooms are interestingly designed to follow themes but you dont go here to just admire the decor .
good drinks and good brunch food . i've been here twice for the weekend recovery and once for late night drinks . it's always good service , good people , good food however , my only qualm is that it's so small ! this means that the wait is always long and the bar area is usually packed . i hate not being able to move when out at a bar for casual drinks , so that's an issue . their drinks are so yummy , though , that it's easy to forgive . i would suggest trying the sugar mama delicious grapefruit ! would come here for dinner and drinks or midday brunch on a weekend .
although the staff is pleasant the food was not . the hamburger patty was so burnt and so thin i could nearly see through it . management definitely needs to check into who is cooking the food . plus our order was wrong . i had to return the horrible patty . i felt bad because it was my idea to come here and i disappointed my mother so much . i also feel bad watching my niece scarf down a burger i didn't know was charred beyond recognition until the end but i should've figured since mine was pretty burnt . shame on me . and shame on this restaurant for serving such low quality food .
this is the better of the two banh mi boys . less busy , a bit more space or so it seems the former may feed into the latter , or vice versa . the staff is friendly and know how to put together a banh mi sandwich or bao . i am partial to the fried chicken bao , which has all the salty protein and sweet bao you want , topped with cucumber , sweet pickles carrots , and mayo . these take longer to make than other bao but it's worth it . the kimchi fries make a nice addition to share it otherwise just get yourself two fried chicken bao , a vanilla or cherry coke , and call it a meal .
came for my 23rd birthday , i love this place . i would recommend the compass to everyone . it is fine dinning so obviously prices are going to be a little high plus your paying to a beautiful view so idk why people complained about it being too expensive . love love this place food was delicious ! amazing staff
i bought a chemical peel on groupon 3 for $ 99 . the last plastic surgeons office i had worked for was $ 99 each . so i thought i would give it a shot . the place looks very small but it winds around and around much larger than you would think . very clean as well . i had nicole do my chemical peel she was friendly and not pushing me into buying a bunch of other products . she explained what she was doing and what to do afterwards . she asked me several times though out if it stung , and if it was comfortable . which it barley did . this is the 1st of 3 so i haven't seen the end result . but as far as customer service goes and being professional goes its lookin good !
the food here is sooooooooooooo amazing ! my favorite is the short ribs with yellow curry , delicious !
we love this place and kwan is the best . the food is amazing and kwan took care of us whenever we are here . highly recommend , you won't regret it .
my beloved husband was starting to look like gandalf in lord of the rings . we had a lot going on for quite a few months and a trip to the barber was just not high on the priority list . as we shopped at the trader joe's in this shopping center , my husband mentioned that since we didn't have any perishables this trip , maybe we could stop in at the barber shop at the end of the shopping center . i am glad we did . there was only one barber , but he took the time and care to cut my husband's hair exactly the way he wanted it and did a very neat trim of the beard and sideburns . there was only one customer ahead of us , so our wait for service was 5 10 minutes . the shop is very clean , has an open feeling to it and i love the dark wood trim . a large flat screen tv kept me happy while my husband visited with the business end of the scissors and electric clippers . the cost was less than fantastic sams charges and it has the bonus of being a local , non chain establishment . we highly recommend this barber .
we needed a new two car garage door . we received a couple of quotes and then happened upon advanced garage door . joel came out the same day i called him and they installed the garage door as he promised the next day . we were able to save over $ 500 from the earlier quote we received . he was on time and finished the work in the time promised .
i would leave zero stars if i could . i drove all the way down here on a thursday afternoon to have happy hour with my boyfriend . they turned us away cause my boyfriend had a tank top on . really ! ? it's las vegas and it's over 100 degrees today and we would be sitting outside . dress code for what ? that's why your're going to eventually go out of business . we went to yard house instead for happy hour where they don't have a dress code . too bad cause blue martini does have good food and drinks .
dined at this restaurant one night this week with the crew . exotic ambience , cool asian decors , friendly staff , nice lighting mix , excellent food and drink selections . their sushi selections are excellent we tried it along with some sake . this place is high in my list for dining , clubbing as well .
i had called and hour prior to coming over here and they said that they would go ahead and put my car right up to go ahead to check my brakes . when i got here i was told there would be an hour and a half wait . then when i went to go check in with daniel . he tried to tell me i talk to him at 10 o'clock this morning . my call log which i brought up show that it was 12 34 pm . i just walked out of the building it is now 1 28 pm . needless to say because of the cocky behavior from daniel i will now be going to good here which is right down the street from my house and their price was about $ 20 more but you know what their customer service is definitely worth it because they were a lot nicer to me . thanks daniel for being so unhelpful and rude to me . you should really take a class in customer service . i am in the medical field also which you have no clue and if i treated a patient the way you treated me i wouldn't have a job . treat your clients better ! very disappointed ! even though you commented back i have taken my business elsewhere the same day and i have successfully have my business done by good year your competition . after being treated like that you'll never have my business again or my family's !
i was referred here by the owner of my suit shop , and i had some very last minute alterations to get done . they were friendly and helpful and got my alterations done with no problems . they do great work and the prices are very reasonable .
i've gone here a few times and need to give credit to the consistently friendly and mostly attentive service i've gotten . decent beer selection great appetizers and flatbreads . warning though to vegetarians i asked about chicken stock in the beer cheese soup and the polenta and was told two different things by two different servers ! if you're serious about what ingredients go in your food , i'd be wary because i feel like i couldn't get a straight answer .
expensive ! i ordered 1lb of wings , garlic bread and cheese , and a diet coke . $ 30 including a $ 3 . 50 tip you have got to be kidding me . i won't be back .
this is a cool bar . casual and friendly , it is an all people place . spenser rocks , so hopefully you are there when she is working . i accidentally deleted the photos of my food but that philly cheese steak was killer . i got it with add on mushrooms and peppers but the add on , although non traditional was worth it because the price is already so reasonable . they have good healthy options i took home the bowl . diced chicken , asparagus and brown rice . be sure to ask for sauce on the side i got teriyaki or it will be a bit dry . overall , my money was well spent .
amazing food ! handmade , delicious dumplings ! flavorful moist chicken ! and more ! can't wait to eat there again . by far , the best truck at the streets of az , food truck fest ! watch out local food trucks , this guy knows what he's doing !
yummy ! can't wait for the new one to open in willoughby . only bad thing is because everyone likes it so much , long waits
this was my 2nd time here in 8 years . doug , the cook , the host and server was awesome ! he has that kind of easy going personality , makes you feel like you've known him forever ! i ordered a the pastrami on rye , it was the best ! he hand carves it himself , thick slices , cooked perfect with a bit of charred crunch on the edges and buttery , grilled toasted to perfection ! hubby enjoyed his mushroom , bacon cheeseburger as well ! oh and the fries ! crispy , crunchy ! don't even need ketchup or ranch with them ! we'll be back to try more off the menu or daily specials !
i took the advanced point and shoot 101 lol , i'm such an amateur because i am learning to use most functions in my amazing panasonic zs20 seriously , great camera ! through trial and error . i know i can benefit from courses to learn fundamental photography skills , theory and technique . this class is basic . i learned to format a memory card and why it's important . i already do that . i also learned the differences between portrait , sports and landscape scenic modes . yawn . but then , it picked up when we started to learn how to shoot in the program mode . i learned more about focus and control focus , iso function and white balance function . granted , i've been learning through trial and error but many of the focus learnings were new to me . the classroom is modern , technology works , and is spacious fits 20 , we were 8 . i noticed that i was the only youth in the class full of senior citizens . i also discovered these students kick my derriere b c they are going on safari trips ! all in all , the class is a great foundational course for anyone starting this hobby . the instructor , courtney , was very knowledgeable and patient . will i return ? of course ! i think the 201 will help me lol ! , and there are some topic specific courses which seem very interesting aperture , creative night photography , composition , urban photography , food photography , etc .
okay kids . i have had so many overwhelmingly positive experiences with the fillmore and its staff , i just can't stand it . i simply must write a review . a word yes , the alcohol prices are astronomical . one word pregame . vbgb is there for a reason . so get your craft beer and suck it up . the fillmore has too much other good stuff to offer for that to be a detractor . staff stellar . i mean , really . these guys and ladies are top notch and are just as kind and helpful as you could dream . i recently spent the better part of 3 days there , and i was treated as one of the family . the bathrooms are clean , and i love the black . facilities . don't know why , but i do . the smoking patio although i don't smoke is the uptown amphitheatre stage . so while you smoke , you can stand on the same stage that really famous people have rocked out on . gosh , that's just cool . i love the vip area , which gets you just high enough to see over the people's heads who are standing in the main floor area , and there are both male and female facilities in the vip area . and a vip only bar . please and thank you . totally worth the price so you don't have to wade through the crowd . i've been to quite a few events besides concerts here , and every time i'm impressed by how versatile the space is . it can have a central focus stage , or lots of smaller areas i . e . vintage charlotte . they also book a lot of the bigger shows coming to town , so it's where i end up ! all in all , any excuse i have , i'm heading over here . huzzah !
i like to come in here and write songs while i eat . i like how the management won't hound me to leave even when i'm on for an hour at least .
lived here for a year and cant wait to move ! the grounds need new grass and rocks . there's always trash surrounding every dumpster . gym is trashed and unusable . pools are pretty dirty and one pool is never even open . cars have been vandalized . thin walls ! cops are here weekly . gates always broke . i can go on and on . not a place to buy , thankfully i only rent ! not to mention the cops just came today because a guy blew something up in the parking lot and created a big fire . kids have been known to create fires in the dumpsters as well .
2 . 5 stars . i wanted to love this place . dim sum and noodles are two of my favorite things . unfprtunately they put us at the counter which has no room for dim sum . they eventually moved us but they seemed to think we were unreasonable . the dim sum itself was good . not as good as lucky dragon was and double the price with less of a variety . the vegetable dumplings were really good and the stuffed mushrooms . the roast duck was very good . flavorful and tender and bonus points for taking it off the bone . that was the only item we ordered off the menu . we wanted to try the spicy cucumbers and a soup but after the experience we had trying to be seated we decided against it . of we ever come back maybe we will try that and skip the dim sum

since living in huntington beach , i will forever be addicted to wahoos . joseph makes my dreams come true . see him at the bar . what a pleasure , a professional to customer service , and a class act . being from the industry myself this is highly appreciated . my husband really enjoy our nights here but joseph made it a little extra special by paying us attention at the bar tables , with his entire bar full . i thoroughly enjoyed his service .
i had a craving for a blt the other day , so i wanted to check out great canadian bagel since it always looks busy in there . it was quiet when i came in . they have the selection of bagels behind glass . there were about 12 choices . i decided on maple , since i thought it would be good with the bacon . the guy took my order and asked if i wanted it toasted , which is a given if you ask me . the menu is very reasonably priced , plain bagels go for $ 1 , half a dozen $ 5 . the additions like cream cheese and butter are only a few cents . they have all day breakfast sandwiches , most going for around $ 5 . you can add on a drink for another $ 1 . 50 . they have some awesome cream cheeses ! there was red pepper , jalapeno , garlic , herbs and spice , to name only a few . you can get a container of cream cheese for $ 4 . 50 . the guy made my bagel , asking if i wanted mustard or mayo . the bagel and a drink cost $ 6 . 50 . it was the most amazing blt bagel i have ever had ! i loved great canadian bagel , i can't wait to go back and try more of their fresh bagels and cream cheeses ! i would definitely hit this place up for a yummy breakfast sandwich too !
used them for a large concrete curb in my back yard . they arrived early , did an awesome job , and finished in under an hour . my friend , who also happens to be a stone contractor , recommended these guys . they are freaking professionals ! i am going to use them for another area where we are planting grass . absolutely awesome experience !
great food big portions . sometimes spotty service late at night . burgers are super good . be sure to ask about the secret steak and shrimp special .
we tried to give it a chance , but every step of the way was painful . were seated and wait people avoided eye contact for 20 minutes 'til we finally flagged one down . our server showed up and said it was confusing that night . ok , fine . we ordered drinks , and then she came back 15 minutes later with no drinks and asked if we knew what we wanted , and we ordered . another 20 minutes and our salads came out no drinks yet . then the meals came , and they were spectacularly ordinary . this was not an inexpensive meal . then the drinks came . one of my party ordered a second drink , since the first was served in a champagne flute of about 3 ounces $ 10 . that second drink never came . lousy service , lousy food , lousy attitude . not going back .
summer is one of the most amazing people i have ever met . the reading she gave me provided so much clarity on my life situations and she really tuned into the areas that needed the most attention without me telling her a thing . she holds nothing back and is very up front with what she sees . i could not believe how accurate she was with the current events in my life that i know i can trust what she says is to come . she is the real deal , there is no doubt about that . i got the opportunity to also sit in on my cousins reading a few days later and it just confirmed to me how real she is . thank you summer , i will definitely be back !
we went here for the first time today . the food is just mediocre bar food . we put lost $ 45 in the gaming , and still paid for our drinks . service was decent , but i see no reason to return .
this is one of my favorite local places to go and eat lunch with my friends and family . food has always been really good . the service is the only reason i am giving it 4 stars . the service has always been either really good or well , not so good sometimes . the free yelp offer was good . they bring u a very decent pinot grigio for the wine . our server was not bad . he could have been a little more attentive to us tho . sometimes it seemed he would kind of disappear and i had to go find him twice . overall a very good restaurant . i would come back here .
yes yes and yes . my husband and i ate here as a last hurrah dinner for our incredible vacation . we came on a sunday evening and were able to get in for a 6 00 reservation outside . like other yelpers suggested , the specialty pastas and where it's at don't even bother looking at the regular menu . our server was incredibly knowledgeable . we asked her suggestion for a full bodied red wine that wasn't too dry . she had one in mind she said wouldn't break the bank turned out to be $ 17 glass one of the lowest on the price scale and to our surprise , she delivered perfectly and we both really enjoyed it . my husband got the pasta with cheese and pepper made as part of the dough , which came with crisped proscuitto , while i went for the homemade sausage and truffle dish . we were truly blown away at how good our dishes were . we both ate the very last bites and still managed to share some tiramisu . this place is amazing and while probably as expensive as a dinner we'd go $ 150 before tip , there were some other places we considered with multiple courses and costs twice the price though still $ on yelp . we would happily do this over again and would recommend to anyone looking for a low key , romantic evening with incredible eats .
i had a great experience here ! everyone was very friendly , especially cameron . he was super funny and sweet and helped us with everything we needed . make sure you guys keep him around , we'll definitely be back !
love this store ! highly recommend ! they have very slim furniture which is perfect for many styles of living in particular condo loft living . we have numerous 7 pieces from them and frankly i wish we had found them sooner as a few of our pieces from other stores are simply bulky . beautiful pieces , beautiful style with multi purpose uses . my husband and i go in regularly as they are one of our favorite stores . new people coming into the neighborhood should be heading here first for sure . owner is great . super friendly , helpful , know their products and really helpful in designing our home .
this is the best spot in town destiny did my hair and we did a complete color change she is amazing you have to go to her as for my manicure and pedicure i've never gotten a better one her name is macy definitely see these two girls and check out the hot tub's and massage therapist as well my massage therapist was rain she did a whole body scrub and it was incredible
i received the mattress and box spring . the mattress seems fine and pretty comfortable . i unfolded the box spring and it didn't unfold completely flat , no matter how hard i tried . so i finally called up customer service and the rep told me it should definitely unfold completely flat , which makes sense . i sent him pictures , showing that it did not . so to his credit , he sent me another within one week . when i received the replacement , i had the same issue . i took very careful pictures and sent to them again , showing that it did not unfold completely . the same rep said it should completely unfold again . then he said he would have his manager call me the next day . the manager did not call . i called back and they debated a bit , then the rep said his manager said that it would lay flat once the mattress was on it . i tried to tell him that it still rocks a bit even with the mattress on it , and that they might have a manufacturing issue , but it was as if they didn't want to hear it , or didn't care . then i asked what they wanted me to do with the extra one they sent me . they told me to ship back , in which i said i am not paying for . then they said to donate it , and i said i don't have time to lug it into my car and take it somewhere . i didn't feel it was my responsibility since it is their product and their issue . then finally they said to throw it away but take a picture of it and send to their customer service , showing that i threw it away . very strange way of handling that , in my opinion . either way , i am out $ 250 or whatever it cost because i am continuing to sleep on a bad box spring . this company really needs to take responsibility if their product is defective , and stop putting it on the customer . given the previous reviews , i guess i should have done my homework before ordering from them . i recommend the mattress so far , just don't get the box spring .
100 reiki master i am going to scream from the rooftops he's amazing because not only did he heal and take all the negativity away but also . his guidance has been so beneficial also showing me how to protect my self from negative energy and much more i have . this man is truly gifted
this establishment has ridiculous prices . they wanted $ 55 just to press a queen size duvet cover and $ 20 apiece to do standard shams . this cover and shams are cotton with no embellishments . i took it to summit cleaners and they charged me $ 15 to press the duvet cover and three dollars per sham . ultra cleaners is overpriced .
it was only right that i invited an old friend from yellowknife to bob the fish tavern on 4th because the tavern itself reminded us both of popular bars up north especially the drinking hole the taku in whitehorse . i was in the mood for a brew and comfort food , and bob's did meet the requirements needed to fill up these two northern canadian gals . sheila our waitress was accordingly donning her flames jersey and we found out that she too lived in inuvik for awhile and was from northern saskatchewan , my side of the planet so it made for an even happier meal i dove into a huge lasagne with garlic toast and my lovely friend ali chowed down on a bob's burger with home cut fries . both meals were washed down with frosty canadian beer and enticing and sometimes indecent conversation . the tavern was sparse tonight even though it was 20 cent wednesday wing night . probably too darn cold . but we heated it up with our spirits and bob's spirits and i must say i had a very warm and satisfying meal at the ol' btft tonight . the only complaint about bob is no dessert , its okay i didn't need the extra calories . cheers !
it had been over a year since i had my carpets cleaned . with two big dogs , two teenagers and two adults , the carpets get lots of use and abuse . they were filthy . rob came out today and did the cleaning and my carpets practically look brand new . even the ones that are 14 years old in the bedrooms ! his prices are extremely competitive and fair . i already have a note on my calendar to call him in 6 months for another cleaning . thanks rob !
another great experience with alan's air . alan is extremely fair and knows his stuff ! i will definitely be using him again .
located in the former mystic lodge aka my casino site the boulder lounge is another dotty's creation . i was there yesterday lots of slot machines and great customer service plus a 24 hour cafe a great improvement from that my casino .
i find it incredibly hard to believe that this place has such glowing reviews . i'll give them credit . the customer service is awesome and they're super friendly . unfortunately , after several separate visits with two different cars i can say i'm more than happy to be taking my business elsewhere . i took my old car in for a new air conditioning compressor and ended up with loud rattling and vibration they just can't find . it was clearly messed up . boyfriend went in with his car numerous times for the axle seal on his car . the first time he brought it in the issue was identified , he was told that the parts would need to be ordered and was sent on his way with the car . one week passed and he hadn't heard from them . it was clear when he finally called that they dropped the ball and never ordered the part as numerous obvious excuses were made . finally the part comes in and they went to work . after bringing the car home fluid was leaking all over the garage floor . when he brought it back he was told that they didn't have the correct tools and just tried to make do with what they had but would order the correct ones to fix the problem . one year later and the same issue shows up on the other side . he brought in photos of the fluid and area the part was leaking . when shown the photos and after looking at the car they say , well , it's dry now . hmmm .
free wifi although you have to log in , once it is connected , my pages wouldn't load , so i end up using my 4g plenty bathrooms and charging stations around the terminals , and bonus for the water bottle fill up station overall , good airport .
used them twice , both were overall pleasant experiences . they are not the most organized but they were honest with me and they fixed my issue both times .
i've been donating at this location since 2009 . the staff is always extremely friendly and welcoming . i love to help out others that are need , and this is a great way to do it ! the office is very clean and the staff is knowledgeable and will make you feel comfortable . i love this place and tell everyone about the positive experiences i've had here !
this place needs to be investigated by local authorities ! the workers here are definitely pocketing the extra money they charge customers for the bill . the menu board has 1 price then when u get to the pick up window the bill is always higher than what the drive thru menu board says ! they're scamming people on the bills for customers ! the owner or manager of this location needs to investigate their employees because i can see a investigation into this store here soon !
this place is ok . the portions are a little small and the cocktails are not as great as they sound . a good place to pop in for a quick drink if you're out and about , but i don't think i'd have a full dinner here .
very reasonable food for a quick meal during a crowded conference and event . prices are normal and service is relatively good .
checked out this place late saturday afternoon it was busy but they accommodated my walk in appointment for a manicure and brow wax . after reviewing the options , i opted for the spa manicure which was $ 10 more than the regular manicure because my hands were quite dry . brow wax was done well she spent quite a bit of time waxing , plucking and then trimming my brows . the wax was a bit hot she kept blowing on it after she put it on but overall , i'm quite pleased . manicure was good the spa manicure essentially meant more cream put on my hands , a longer massage on my lower arms 2 3 min and then she wrapped my cream laden hands in plastic wrap for a few minutes . compared to the woman next to me who had a regular manicure , my spa upgrade for $ 10 was not worth it . my manicure was done well , she trimmed my nails , fixed up my cuticles , put the colour on nicely . my only complaint is that after putting me on the dryer for 10 minutes , she said i was ready to go . i questioned this because other places had me drying for 15 20 minutes but she insisted it was fine . i paid , left the spa , got into my car , looked down on my nails and sure enough there were two nails that marks because they weren't cured yet . they were cleaning up around the spa since it was close to closing time so maybe that's why they rushed me out . otherwise , i would recommend this place the price was right if you don't get the spa manicure ! the atmosphere is nice i just know to be more insistent on allowing more dry time for my colour .
this movie cinema is awesome ! great atmosphere ! not only they have the most comfortable seats but the food is great too . you can order right in the movie theater in one of the restaurants or inside of the auditorium . you can buy tickets in advance or online and reserve your seats . the prices are reasonable but if you are looking for discounts , they have $ 5 tuesday all day and $ 5 thursday for students . make sure to sign up with the reward card too .
this was my first time at fancy pets . i brought my pup frankie in for a full grooming service . though , it took longer than what i expected , this was the best grooming service frankie has ever had . my biggest concern was the shape of frankies face and the length of her hair . the groomers at fancy pets did exactly what i wanted . frankies face was the perfect shape and her hair was not super short . fancy pets totally hooked frankie up . as you can see in the picture , it had been awhile until frankie actually got a haircut . partly because the last experience at a different salon was horrible . i was taking a real gamble with fancy pets that i'm very happy to say paid off . thank you fancy pets for everything that you have done ! you will definitely see frankie more often !
had a frustrating experience at this office . i let office personnel know and was told that i'd receive a call back . i ended up just paying a bill for services that i did not receive . during that call i was told , thank you for paying this in good faith , someone will call you back . it's been a month and i haven't heard from anyone .
i ordered ravioli and it was great ! small portion but more then filling , i also ordered the nana meatballs but they forgot to put in and had after my meal but the bar tender compensated and gave us a free desert ! . great atmosphere and would come again .
ordered the family meal to go and it was great ! had the chicken and tri tip with mac and cheese and fried okra . chicken was excellent and tri tip even better . i guess i'm not a fan of okra cuz i haven't found any that i like yet , but everyone else said it was good . mac and cheese was good . bbq sauces are yummy but the employees were the best !
rainbow donuts makes the best donuts period . this staff is very friendly and their prices very reasonable .
nice atmosphere , friendly waitstaff and well priced wines . they carry high west which is a bonus . good spot for a date night or drinks out with friends .
had a little trouble with the initial deal but the gm personally met with me days later and adjusted the numbers to fit my expectations and budget .
one of my front teeth cracked while eating lunch at work today and i needed it fixed asap . my regular dentist in bloor west was booked so i decided to check out liberty village dental and am so happy that i did ! i was able to get an emergency appointment an hour later and was extremely satisfied with the work dr . watson and her assistant did . they were an expert team and i felt like i was in good hands . my tooth looks awesome better than before actually ! . highly recommend this place !
this place is amazing ! i have been going to the cheffinis hot dog stand on fremont street before this official spot opened . i just came for the first time and i highly recommend it ! the cheffinis dog is obviously my favorite and the empanadas ! they also serve great draft beer ! loved it .
best mexican food around . you can always tell good mexican food by their rice and beens . you won't be disappointed .
i should start by saying i like greasy spoon dive breakfast joints . with that said , this is a great place to grab bacon and eggs in the morning . it was clean , and the service was quick . if you are in the area check it out .
not sure why market is in the name nothing to buy on the shelves . but service was great and food was solid . i think they need to market to surrounding neighborhoods because it could be a local favorite despite the name that doesn't fit . mostly italian with some spanish dishes thrown in . plenty of options including kids menu .
i read all the negative reviews and thought i'd take a pass on this place , but then wound up meeting friends there anyway . only a few tables were occupied so maybe we were lucky , but we found the service to be great , the food was excellent and the portions were very generous . we really , really liked this place !
i may have to come back a few more times to see why everyone is going bananas for the place . our food was awesome but the service was reallllly slow . the young lady taking the orders was extremely polite and friendly but it felt like it took forever to first get up to the window and then to receive our food . i ordered the big jim which was a biscuit sandwich that was huge with a friend chicken inside covered in gravy , cheese and bacon . i threw on some louisiana hot sauce and went at it . i had to eat it with a fork and nice because it was such a good hot mess i couldn't pick it up without ruining the layers . my girl ordered the little birdy which was a fried chicken piece topped with cheese and sandwiched in between a biscuit , both came with a couple pieces of watermelon and both were satisfying . the fact that they close pretty late is awesome and its probably one of the main reasons why i would come back here .
i love harolds , but the service is probably the worst service i've ever had . every single time i've gone , the service is freaking terrible . i come back because it's harrolds . its a cave creek landmark . train your servers better , harrolds . they seriously are the worst .
looking for something different went down the strip to find something new and happened upon this place . figured i would give it a shot and try it . they got me in very quickly party of 1 so not much wait and was seated . started with a nice glass of red wine and they brought out warm bread and a carrot salad . normally i'm not find of carrots but this changed my mind , it was great in the bread . i ordered the salmon and it was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon i have had . many places overcook the salmon but this was done just right . the menu had a good mix of steaks , fish , and chicken offerings so there should be something for everybody . moderately priced for vegas so it was a great value . definitely will be one of my stops next time i'm in vegas .
came here with my girlfriend for a fun , casual lunch . located in kierland commons shopping district next to north banana republic . small , contemporary dining room with casual cool ambiance . seated and greated promptly and politely . the server addressed my food allergies with sincere concern . ordered the hummus to start which came with thick , warm freshly cooked pita bread triangles . the hummus was delicious ! a twist on the usual with lime juice , creamy feta , red onion and grape tomatoes . a must have ! we both ordered the green goddess salad with seared salmon , cooked to order , medium . romaine tossed in a green goddess dressing with thinly shaved romano pecorino cheese . tossed in were bits of crisp snap peas , broccoli and pistachios . another favorite ! prices were very reasonable . i paid $ 36 for the hummus , salad with salmon and a 9 oz pour of pinot grigio , also delicious . if you're in the kierland area make sure to stop here for a delicious and healthy lunch or dinner . the menu was impressively stacked with one of a kind good for you eats .
i have had to wait over an hour on several occasions . i've been struggling with uti's or 4 months and now have a bacterial infection . my labs have not come back and they have no idea when they will . i was told , if you are in that much pain , then go to the urgent care . . well we all know urgent care isn't going to be able to do anything more if the dipstick test wasn't adequate and it had to go out for culture . urgent care is not magic . it's just another $ 250 to say they'll need to send it out for culture . i can't understand poor customer service , we are actually customers and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect . maybe the staff are overbooked . it seems like most dr's at any practice tend to book patients every 15 minutes which makes just 1 go over and the day is shot . my mother and father see this practice on the west side of the valley and they really like them . my daughter has as well , she has changed dr's so maybe i should smarten up as well .
not terrible but not any means special either . the greeter was about the only sincere person in the joint who seemed interested in making sure we learned the lay of the land and how the process unfolds . beyond that , associates were happy to treat folks like they were quickly just herding cattle . a 'manager type' doing some office work on a table nearby was on her cell phone and occasionally looked up over her glasses at guests , but absolutely no life otherwise from her . an associate stocking drinks lids made folks hang around while he finished stocking vs . letting folks get their lids and be on their way . it was black friday lunch time and i was looking forward to a chicken bbq sandwich . i was denied , they only offer chicken on a bone . i wanted a light sandwich considering the heavy eats the day before . despite my fridge holding pounds of turkey , i ended up with a turkey sandwich . my regret immediately sat in when i realized my only condiments for my sandwich was commercial packaged mayo , cut onions and pickles or bbq sauce . the sides were pre packaged coleslaw mix swimming in mayo , potatoes swimming in mayo , beans or 'new potatoes' which is steamed red potatoes but then swimming in butter . my husband liked the brisket . any repeat business will be from him for the occasional lunch because i can land mediocre food and service anywhere else .
i have eaten here in the past but stopped by again so i could critically evaluate the food for a yelp review . i arrived 2 pm and was promptly seated . there was a moderate amount of ambient noise with the music , but i liked the fun atmosphere of the place . i ordered the yamato and sao paulo rolls since they looked like the most interesting rolls on the menu . the food arrived rather quickly . the yamato roll really looked spectacular with the gold leaf , but there were only three pieces and there was a sweet sauce that completely overpowered the roll so i could not taste the foie gras . the sauce was tasty , but it would have been nice if the right balance were achieved . the sao paolo roll had a variety of fish topping the rolls , and it was quite tasty , but not worth $ 24 . my server was attentive and polite . while the food was good , it was way overpriced given the multitude of dining options on the strip .
i've stayed here twice once in 2010 and once in 2008 . i hate it , but location wise this hotel is amazing ! it's in the middle of the strip so it's minutes away from the venetian and less than 5 minutes away from the forums and fashion island shopping . ventilation in the older hotels are shitty since you can smell all the cigarette smoke , and that's defiantly the case here . i do however like the performance they have in the middle of the casino with impressionist dressed and singing as diana ross and elvis . rooms are reno level and not vegas status , it's like 3 star hotel level . the only reason i've stayed here twice is because the rooms during new years were only $ 50 since my uncles a high roller . if you stay here stay in your room as least as possible and just come back to pass out ! better yet stay somewhere else and do it big , i mean it is vegas !
thought i'd give it another shot . my second time eating here and it disappointed me again . the food is not very good , in my opinion . i got the huevos rancheros and it was very watery . my dad ordered the carnitas tacos and they were chunks of meat rather than shredded . my dads cup of water and coke were both dirty . we asked for a spicier salsa which we got and when we got the bill , we were charged for it ! i swallowed my pride , left a minimal tip and went on my way knowing i'll never eat here again . again , this is my opinion and others may like it . i must say though , the margaritas here are one of the best !
first stop when we got to vegas and it did not disappoint ! i got the steak salad and it was amazing ! the signature slut is really good too ! quick service and good food .
we ate here last night for our anniversary . we both barely made it home and were immediately sick . the restaurant was very busy and dining experience felt very rushed . was not like our other visits , which were very good . we will come back , but will try to visit at non peak times . we arrived at 6 40pm and were seated at 7 10 . there were very comfortable seating outside in shade and servers were excellent .
van was ready for us when we got there and check in was quick . they had the best price of many enterprise rental places in the area we checked . only complaint we have is with the enterprise rewards program . couldnt use our points for a one way rental . and phoenix airport will not let enterprise outside of airport pick us up so we took a cab to the rental office , but it was very close to the airport . rental office , price and van were great !
ive been coming here every now and then for the past year and theyve improved a lot . their sushi used to be sloppy and not made with care but i came here recently and its better , their chicken bento box is great too with noodles . sometimes they run out of ingredients for the rainbow roll which is my favorite roll and it tastes plain . and i feel sometimes with the right ingredients it still has no flavor another thing , they need to stay on top of things , because i went there and there were no utensils or chopsticks or soy sauce packets and when i asked he said they were there . uh no . but i definitely recommend the hawaiian roll if you like spicy food .
i went here today and the place formerly known as wadaa street tacos has changed its name , so i'm just going to repost my review from the other name . i'm a fan of authentic street tacos and this is a great place to get them . they grill the meat right in front of you , so the whole place smells great when you walk up . the tacos are tasty and i can easily eat 4 or 5 for lunch . it's truly just a hole in the wall , and there is no place to sit , so be prepared to find a spot on the sidewalk or take your food somewhere else . oh , and don't get the red sauce on your fingers and then rub your eye or you'll be looking for an eyewash station pretty fast , lol . p . s . i'll bet these tacos taste even better after a night out at the clubs in the area ! oh , and for those complaining that the tacos are expensive maybe you should look around and recognize that you're in scottsdale , not the avenues !
in las vegas and tried gordon ramsey's but the best burger we had was here . however , being from california my favorite burger joint is still in n out burgers , a double double , protein style and animal style ! one of my favorite gourmet chefs is hubert keller and this is his burger restaurant in vegas . love it and will return on our next visit to vegas !
had the beef liver with rice and caramelized onions . medium rare was done nicely and the onions were great . not too bad for the $ 15 price .
i loved this place i wish i was in town longer so i could try more of the menu items . i had the beet salad and avocado bruschetta . both dishes were fresh and enjoyable . the location was awesome ! such a beautiful part of town and so walkable . the decor is moroccan style with a gorgeous large outdoor space . i can't wait to go back !
this was our third or fourth time coming to the babystacks chain and our second time at this venue . what can i say ? just that this has become a regular stop on our travels to las vegas . especially for my kids . we were all the way over in mandalay bay and my kids wanted nothing but babystacks for breakfast . our orders consisted of s'mores pancakes , cinnabon pancakes , rocky road pancakes , and cookies and cream pancakes . throw in some seasoned potatoes and one slide order of eggs and all four of us were taken care of . not to mention , my mother in law accompanied us and she is a strict vegetarian . the chef made a very nice skillet for her consisting of potatoes and cheeses and a multitude of vegetables in a spicy sauce that kept her very happy as well . thank you for accommodating that ! our orders were delicious , tasty . sinfully good ! my one big question is how come you don't find this chain in one of the big resort hotels ? i think it would be a grand slam . the masses who wander the strip on foot have no clue what a great little place this is ! better yet , keep it our little secret
been banking with chase bank for like forever . enjoyed their fast service and friendly staffs . great location just off loop 202 us 60 and within minutes from arizona state university asu mesa community college mcc .
agreed . their cheesecake tastes like discount store bought cheesecake . i mean , i could by a bailey's cheesecake as loblaws that is heavenly and have a whole cheesecake for the price of 3 slices here .
such a beautiful space for all your aerialist dreams ! great vibe and the owners were very welcoming . i would definitely come back to train here again when visiting vegas .
honest , knowledgable , reasonable and thorough . they'll educate you , visually and verbally , with what was going on and also warn you about botch jobs on your car in my case my oil filter . my mechanic , sus , didn't change the filter because that was just one more expense when i could just get it fixed no swindling there . this is my new place . thank you a million times over .
hilariously overpriced and absolutely terrible . there are so many other incredible restaurants to dine at in las vegas . please do yourself a favor and avoid this awful establishment at all costs .
disappointing . glasses arrived 3 weeks late was not satisfied with them but sales staff was not willing to exchange glasses . they wanted me to buy another frame to put the lenses in . expensive and sales staff not helpful unless you are spending . not all bad dr . was pleasant . for 325 glasses and a family of 5 i will take my business to a company that wants to make sure i am satisfied . as the sales agent stated they are too small to guarentee anything like the big stores .
my husband took my 2 . 5 year old and me to breakfast for mother's day . the service was extremely nice , but yes , a little slow . once we received our food , it was fabulous ! they give you so much food for your money and it is just like mom used to make . we will definitely be back !
got the munchies ? best toasted subs in mesa ! if you can dig the stoner ambiance , the atmosphere has such a chill vibe , music that takes you back down memory lane , and the subs that just hit the spot ! cant pass up their fruity rice krispy treats either . highly recommend their white widow with easy shrooms mannnnn !
this place moves in slow motion avoid at all cost . i've given this location multiple tries but it disappoints every single time . this morning a lady was in training without anyone training her ! really ? after 50 min . i had to leave to get to a meeting . never again .
this place was excellent and the experience started with our very awesome server petar . he was attentive but not overbearing . i had the perfectly grilled cheese with sweet potato fries . we had 8 in our party and everyone got something different . everyone enjoyed their food . we were there early on a saturday 4 pm and it was pretty empty . highly recommended !
a work friend and i come here for lunch sometimes for salad and beer . the buffalo shrimp salad is amazing ! friendly server and great food . really love this place .
we dined at nine on nine on a recent trip to pittsburgh . we appreciated that the hostess was accomodating our table was originally near the door and when we requested to be moved it was no problem . our waitress , while overall pretty good , was very slow in coming to the table to greet us and take drink orders . i ordered a cosmo and it was made perfectly i only wish the glass had been filled instead of the short pour i got . the food is very good . i had the special lamb chops and , while a little more fatty than i prefer , were tasty and cooked to my specifications .
we happened to visiting my boyfriends family while we were in vegas and they decided to take us to get some sushi . we arrived here around 7 for the dinner buffet which was only $ 22 dollars . there was no wait time for a table and the service was fast and very friendly . we had a pretty good size group and they were very accommodating . i love sushi and i am always very skeptical when i go to sushi places , especially for an all you can eat sushi . i have a very weak stomach , so fresh is definitely key . some buffets that you go to that serve sushi usually have their sushi sitting over ice and sitting there for who knows how long . here at sin city , you order all that you want and they make them fresh as soon as you finish eating some of your other rolls . also , i'm not a big octopus fan , but they offered us some octopus dish that was cut up into pieces , it was very good . they offer an array of custom roll's , but of all , i would have to say that the tiger roll is my favorite ! the ahi spicey tuna on top is literally so tender , it's almost like butter , it totally melts in your mouth . it doesn't even have that fishy taste and the spice on it , is just right . i am definitely coming back here when i visit in december . i totally think they need to open one up in la !
this is my second visit to the property and it continues to be absolutely outstanding . the staff is super friendly and the look and feel of the lobby since the renovation is mind blowing . as i was taking pictures of the separate but harmonious lobby spaces , the security manager walked over and introduced himself to me . he gave me an overview of the property and renovations . the rooms are well appointed and comfortable . and i love the aveda bath products . the lounge staff is equally nice and food quality is fine for a property of this caliber . sara in the lounge is absolutely excellent . she bends over backwards for you !
i'm shocked i have not written a review for one of my favorite restaurant . this is my go to place for late night food , or catching up with friends . i love the sushi bar and the sitting down japanese area in the back of the restaurant . i've always had great service even at its busiest times . my favorite drink is the grape fruit sochu ! it's so cool juicing your own fruit and pouring it's remnants into this sour nasty rubbing alcohol thing . their food is so amazing . i love the wasabi green beans , crab fried rice , ramen , sushi , and so many other dishes . their specials are posted all over the restaurant on index cards so it's fun walking around seeing if they have anything new or weird to try . their prices are always super reasonable , and their food quality is superb . confused why they were closed last year like 4 times by the health department . cause i mean i've been fine and i eat here all the time lol ! i love you ichiza !
mr cooks has 2 guys that go door to door putting up flyers . they stole my last cigarette off the front porch and i called in and mr cook to tell him and he acted like he didn't speak english . such bs .
came here on suggestion from a hotel reception desk staff a place off the beaten path where locals go . off the beaten path is a bit of an understatement from downtown , it was an interesting walk through a rough around the edges neighborhood . i'd suggest taking a taxi if going for a late dinner as we did . i had a really great glass of wine , shared the beet salad , and steelhead trout for my main . beet salad had buffalo mozzarella and basil so i came across as a caprese with golden beets not bad , but not really what i expected . as far as the trout , i found the horseradish to be a bit overpowering and the coulis too smoky for the mild fish . my date had the steak frites which he found to be too chewy for his liking . service was fair . it was loud and pretty crowded on a thursday evening . i'd try it again when in toronto .
polite and helpful staff for a movie theater , but that's the extent of my compliments . when it was the sundance theater it had a more upscale vibe and it also somehow seemed more accommodating and spacious . with the 'renovations' they've closed off a couple exits and it felt very cramped . the lobby is a madhouse and everything looks like a rundown version of the sundance setup . the theater itself is still comfortable and picture sound was fine waaayyy too many previews though not sure if this is their policy or just the movie we saw , but it was obnoxious ! all in all , it offers none of the charm or discounts ! of sundance .
being a connoisseur of spaghetti , i am always looking to try new recipes . although initially hesitant to try barzinis , i decided to give them a shot . and boy , was i pleasantly surprised . their spaghetti and meatballs is comparable to restaurant recipes i've tried in the past . and for such a great price , it's hard to pass up . once i learned that they deliver , i was sold . it has now become my favorite go to spot for spaghetti when i am too lazy to prepare my own and i don't feel like spending $ 15 $ 20 on one entree . i highly recommend trying this locally owned spot . you may be pleasantly surprised .
while waiting 10 minutes for a waitress that never showed up , we watched the line back up at the sunday brunch buffet , which had started only 15 minutes earlier , because there were no plates . as we got up to leave , i asked to speak with the manager . i explained the pathetic situation and mike the manager looked at me as if i had two heads , shrugging his shoulders and providing no apology . needless to say , we won't be back . we went across the street to olive garden and have been pampered by five different workers , including the manager . now this is customer service !
this place sucks ! second time they broke my lug nut while changing my tires . do not go here ! plus they are rude and don't care !
here are the do's and the don'ts . do come in a group . the more the merrier ! don't forget to bring ur nv id . it's free entry for locals ! do remember to bring some dollars . the dancers are easy on the eyes . so don't forget to make ur dollas rain ! do know that the dancers are quite friendly with females too ! do enjoy the music . and do have some fun ! don't drink too much or act like a douche . or security might kick u out ! convenience easy to find . right off fwy russel blvd exit . ample parking . entertainment strip club in vegas , sure why not ? definitely better than hustler club . ambiance dim lighting , not overly bright with colored spot lighting . price free for locals with nv id overall 4 stars . short review cuz it's a strip club , what more can i say ? nuff said .
i have been a big fan of food by fabio since the beginning . simple food for a simple price . they offer a small size and a large size with different calorie amount to accommodate my needs . the biggest thing is the flavor of the food for me . i love to eat so flavor is important to me . food by fabio offers a ton of flavor in their meals compared to other meal prepping companies having real bland food . highly recommend giving them a try for a week . must try his french toast !
very little difference since changing hands new staff i think , and a couple added menu items , but basically the same as when it was phoenix coffee the same phoenix brand coffee , served in the same atmosphere for the same prices . even the same kinds of live music and poetry events although i tend to prefer quiet myself . i can easily find a seat with power and internet to get some work done , and i like their drinks . so , no complaints here ! i did notice , since someone else mentioned it , that my mocha was poured out of a milk jug from the cupboard . in my ignorance , i can't say whether pre mixing such drinks is normal , or a bad sign . i don't usually get straight coffee hopefully that is made fresh . i wish they were open later , but i see this fall they plan to return to 9pm weekday closing , which will be welcome , and 10pm on live event nights check their site . one issue i must touch on it's nice and quiet other than live event nights for working or visiting . however , the silence is shredded by an obnoxiously short music loop one cd maybe ? which is mostly generic pop music from recent years . some of it is raucous repetitive barking , the likes of which only a 9th grader could love . i'm listening to it right now , and more than anything i want hard alcohol . and i don't even drink . that's now obnoxious the music is . if only the same songs didn't keep repeating ! kill me . take a sofa cushion and put me out of my misery . i shouldn't share my top secret parking tip , but i will the front lot fills up fast , but there's a small rear lot . you can't get to it via mayfield , but you can get to it from either side street , green or victory same way you'd enter for the drive through .
back again to our favorite sushi restaurant eddy is a great sushi chef he has our favorites alice is very professional waitress . we always have a great time sushi bomb . !
update according to my budget tracker , i've been to this zoyo 36 times now . unfortunately , although i started off enjoying it , over time they've stopped rotating many of their flavors and one or more of their flavors have been out the last few times i've been here . in addition , as i mentioned in my original review , their liquid toppings fudge , camel are in room temperature squeeze bottles . they don't keep them filled all the way , which makes it very difficult and slow to actually dispense anything from the bottles . i think i'll need to start looking elsewhere . zoyo is a local chain of frozen yogurt places that is similar to other chains in phoenix and other cities e . g . , menchies . they have about 6 7 different soft serve machines mounted into to the wall , each serving two different flavors of frozen yogurt . you are able to walk around and taste any of them using small sample cups . when you're ready , you grab a container and fill it with whatever you want . there is a topping station with many different toppings and a few sauces . at the end , you put your yogurt on a scale , and you pay based on how much it weighs . zoyo's frozen yogurt is decent , though you can definitely tell it is not ice cream . it has a slightly more icy watery texture than ice cream and even other soft serve frozen yogurt i've had , but the flavors are pretty good , and there is enough of a selection that you should be able to find something you like . the assortment of toppings is very good they have maybe 25 30 different choices , though i wish some of the sauces like the chocolate fudge were heated instead of kept in squeeze bottles at room temperature . because most of their flavors are low fat or non fat and they even have some no sugar added types , it is a good health conscious alternative to ice cream or frozen custard .
seamus , the owner did a fantastic job restoring the granite countertops in our kitchen . he repaired , condition polished and sealed the counters as well as the granite on the backsplash and it looks like new . he was also prompt , courteous , professional , knowledgable and his prices were fair . we plan to use him again for granite in other areas of the home and would highly recommend him .
my husband ate here one time without me and said it was too salty , so for the past 2 years , i've avoided this place . while waiting in this area to get picked up , i had a craving for chicken fingers and decided to stop in and omg i was so mad at my husband . to think , for two years i was missing out on some of the best chicken fingers ever created too much enthusiasm , maybe ? . their dipping sauce is just a simple ketchup mayo spices mix , but i'm easily won over by the combination apparently . i like how their fries have ridges , with a good mix of mushy fries to schlop up sauce and ketchup and crispy ones for texture . i was also really impressed with the service here reminded me a bit of chick fil a in the south , where they'll deliver the food to your table most of the time , the food was ready long before the customers could even decide on which soda to get . the staff does a great job turning over tables and moving things along swiftly . now i understand why their drive thru line is always packed , but i do need to start coming here less and remember , this place is still fast food .
it's hard to find fresh food in the restaurant business these days . this is probably one of the best fresh foods and clean restaurant i've ever eaten at . and the staff is very friendly and helpful .
opened for decades . i remember going here on the weekends some 20ish years ago , until i moved north . the beef noodle was as delicious as i remembered . however the couple of appetizers i had , like the green onion pancake , pork wrap and pan fried dumplings were delicious , but just not as delicious as some of the new comers in and around the gta . but the price is defiantly more affordable than the rest .
so our first family trip to jack in box off yuma was a disappointment . go to order fish sandwich and nuggets . sorry no ice tea needs to be made . ok will take water . ohhh and sorry no fries will u take curly fries . sure i guess we will . get up to pay after around 10 min wait two cars ahead of us and young lady comes to window sorry no nuggets . so after another disappointment we decided to leave for home empty handed and hungry .
heard so much hype about shake shack , and was excited to try it . i got a bacon cheeseburger , fries , and a small drink . my wife got the basic burger combo . this set us back around $ 25 . for that price i expected much more in terms of quality . the burger itself was tasty but it was ridiculously small , and the bun was a soggy mess . the crinkle fries were below average and the soda fountain is behind the counter , meaning you have to wait for refills . i did not have a shake and i'm willing to try them , but i'll never waste my money on the food again . smashburger has much better food , far more toppings , better fries and is a bit less expensive . bottom line don't come here hungry and expect to leave full .
i am an old guy that has been playing guitar off and on since high school . i finally got serious and decided to look at a new fender strat . brent was awesome , guitars are like pizza , everyone likes theirs a specific way . this was a true awakening for me . turns out the gibson was the one that balanced and felt the best . the entire team was warm and friendly letting me play any of the guitars i wanted . i skipped any that would cost me a divorce . i found the gibson chocolate 50's replica to fit my needs exactly . she is not the flashiest girl in town , but man she plays like a ferrari . i am sitting in the airport ready to fly back home and cannot wait to plug it in again and scare my dogs . if you are looking for great people that know what they are talking about then go to sam ash and ask for brent . old guys rule !
grilled chicken salad was good but not great . love the burger and garlic fries . menu was really dirty and service is ok but not great
i've been going to this restaurant for at least 3 years now . i typically always get the vermecilli noodle , 42 to be exact , and am never disappointed . be careful with the fish sauce you get on the side , though . you can really overdo it if carelessly dump it into your bowl . when i'm sick , i'll change it up and go with a beef combination pho . the food here is always fresh , and the family who owns the place is very friendly and remembers me and my order every time i come back . if you're new to vietnamese , just ask the waitress what she recommends for you . she'll help you pick out dishes that don't have strange parts of beef , tripe , or other things that the average cheeseburger eater would be grossed out by . every other pho restaurant i've tried hasn't compared in the slightest to my favorite pho nhat in university and rural !
food here is great . i really like the woman who owns it , but service can be better . my favorite go to restaurant .
fantastic tacos and excellent service . do your tastebuds a favor and stop in . al pastor is phenomenal and carne asada nachos are perfect for sharing .
get the brio salad ! family friendly ! outdoor seating available . bread basket yummy ! kids menu fabulous ! includes salmon ! service was friendly but she forgot to bring my drink i will still come back , nice place to bring out of town guests .
highly recommended company . very professional at a very reasonable price . quick to respond with service needed and done in a small window of time needed in a timely fashion . thank you for you assistance .
it had been a while since i had some fry bread as the only place in california i knew of closed down years ago . we decided to try angelinas out as it had some great reviews . location is small but very welcoming . my brother and i each ordered 2 fry bread tacos with asada and shredded beef . the gentleman taking our order seemed surprised that we were each ordering 2 tacos . when we received our order we knew why . the tacos were massive and we're stuffed with refried beans , meat and tons of cheese . our table was sorrounded by these delicious creations and everyone looked at us like we were members of man vs food . the fry bread tacos were outstanding . the fry bread was nice and crunchy . the beans and meat also had a great taste and the cheese topped off the deliciousness . after 1 taco we were stuffed so we threw in the flag . the prices are great too as each taco is $ 6 but well worth it as portions are huge . i sure wish they had a place like this in fullerton ca because i would be there daily . they also have other mexican food items on the menu if fry bread is not your thing . will have to make angelinas one of my go to places next time i'm in glendale . highly recommend !
i have been here a couple of times for dinner , hookah or both . the food here is reasonably priced and well seasoned . the lights are dim so it gives it a lounge feel , the music is nice as well . the staff have all been friendly and helpful . some of the food items include kebabs , hummus , gyros , calamari , lamb , baklava etc . there is not a good selection of wine so i prefer having their teas which are phenomenal . the rice pudding is excellent as well . this is a a middle eastern restaurant you must experience .
really good italian good . it's a little pricey but the food is good . staff has always been friendly and have yet to have a bad experience here . will definitely go back !
in the cleveland area for a wedding so we figured we'd try out one of the better reviewed diners in the area . when we arrived there was a wait but we didn't wait that long since there were two of us . most of the seats are for two people so you may be seated before others if there are only two of you . staff is friendly and attentive so that was great . we ordered the greek omelette and the alpine omelette along with a side of pancakes . the food overall was decent . the greek omelette was good but the alpine was a bit tasteless and too eggy . the home fries were ok , i had to drench mine in hot sauce . the banana walnut pancakes were very good but for $ 7 and getting only three it was a little overpriced . lastly , food took between 20 25 mins to arrive from the time we ordered , a bit long for us . wouldn't come back if there's a wait but otherwise pretty good .
the chef at the 9 recommended i check this place out , and i'm sure glad we did . had the almond croissant , loaded with flavor , and the texture was perfect . also had a caramelized croissant , cant remember the name , but was amazing . welcome to the neighborhood , we will be back for a flatbread . the chef owner wasnt in while we were there , but we met his father who was very helpful and proud of his son . the host manager was very friendly and helpful as well .
just wanted to truly thank niko , kat , patrick and brynn for each spending time with me tonight . p had one of the best meal experiences i've had in a long long time . i travel for my job and all the staff at the ritz highly recommended me visiting this new establishment . i already thanked all of them for the fantastic recommendation . the food was superb but more importantly to me was the staff . very attentive to all details . they must go through some rigorous bootcamp process because each and everyone i encountered was customer focused and enjoyed their being there as much as i did . sorry if i forgot to mention anyone but i without question give them 10 stars . yes i realize it only goes up to 5 ! enjoy !
been there 2 times . it is way overpriced and the service is average . capital grille is much better . mortons is better . not a big fan .
ordered the 10 tacos for $ 30 best thing to do if you just want tacos and want to try different ones ! for me being mexican from california i could say they have great flavors to the tacos . also add lime to everything ! i always ask for extra .
ralph and his crew were great ! called him literally last minute asking if he'd be available to unload a moving truck in three hours and agreed . he then called again an hour or two later just to confirm that we'd be in town when originally planned and we were right on schedule . he and his crew showed up right on time and got right to work , unloading the truck in a little less than an hour . he charged us for a two hour minimum and we gladly paid him . with little time to prepare for what we were having him do , i'm glad he agreed to help and will be using him again for any of our moving needs .
awesome place , they restaffed the whole office and the service now is great . there were more glasses to choose from than most stores i've been to . thy explained everything very clearly and worked with me to get my best set up .
i had the king cut prime rib . i skipped the bread from reading the reviews . clan chowder was average at best . prime rib should have been medium , was close to well done , so sen pack and was perfect . quality of meet was not the highest , it was tough . broccoli and carrots were cold . service was good and atmosphere was nice .
amazing ! traveling on business and enjoyed sitting at the bar . matt spears or pickles had amazing recommendations ! i started with the devil eggs topped with crispy oysters then had the salmon medium with the seasonal veggies of green beans , tomatoes and potatoes yum ! zach the gm was super friendly thanks billy at marriott city for the best recommendation !
great place ! had the carnitas nachos a margarita and had a scorpion shot sooo good ! will come back !
beyond donuts is beyond amazing . they've got a wide yet fresh selection of donuts . the family that owns and operates it are some of the nicest people i've met . you want to get here early because what they make in the morning is what they have for the day . they're fresh and hot and amazing . the breakfast sandwiches and burritos are huge and we'll worth the money . they're simply amazing . i'd give this place 10 stars if it was possible .
favorites were the baja fish and beef cheek tacos ! was pretty bumping for 5pm on a sunday , had a really awesome vibe and great music playing . was a bit small on the inside so i could see the wait being long at other times , but otherwise was a great place !
came in to have brunch with my family . place was not busy for a saturday , maybe 4 tables were filled . maitre d was nice but not so attentive . there was a kid with us , so she give her a coloring menu but no crayons . we had to ask for it . our waitress came 5minutes after we sat down to ask for our drinks then never returned . after another almost 10 minutes of waiting we stood up and left . we told the maitre d we're leaving seems like everyone is so busy . too bad , we really wanted to try their food
this popular , new dt nook reminds me of a trendy nyc brunch hangout . it's not so much the food or the decor that causes me to reminisce , it's the fact that this place has limited seating , excess patrons , and folks will wait a long time for a table even though there are other good restaurants within walking distance . if you're dining alone , you can plant yourself at the counter almost immediately . if you're with a group . the wait can be as long as 45 mins , and unlike hash house a go go , which also always has a long wait , they don't have a pager to give you and you can't just sashay up to the bar while you wait for a table . i will tell you , these guys really care about their customers . when i received my downtown benedict one of their signature dishes i found that the poached eggs were hard boiled . i didn't even complain , but the manager noticed a look of disappoint on my face and rushed in and had the dish re fired . the benedict was not bad . i picked up a slightly off putting vinegar flavor from it . there was probably too much vinegar in the poaching liquor . the side of skillet grilled potatoes was pretty good fresh not frozen . hollandaise sauce had a smooth , creamy texture . all ingredients tasted fresh , and the plating and presentation was , as i like to say , pretty . i would recommend eat . it may not blow you away , but it's a decent breakfast haven . just be aware of the wait and the noise .
a reliable pest control provides courteous , friendly service , and outstanding pest control service ! thanks a million !
this place is horrible . the only store that is keeping this mall alive is the t t . the second floor is almost completely empty where all the units are either for lease or for sale . very poor management too . they don't even have an information board at the main entrance to direct people to the businesses in the mall . that's is why you see all those business flyers stuck all over the windows of the mall , because there is no way for people to know where the stores are in the mall . it's also very strange to see hand written drawn direction signs in the covered garage , instead of professionally printed ones . it just looks very sloppy and unprofessional . i only come here to shop at t t if i'm the area because i know there will be parking .
if you have a craving for hainan chicken , this is the place ! casual setting with delicious food and friendly service . my recommendation 1 . hainan chicken rice combo with your preference of white or dark meat . 2 . feeling adventurous ? try the braised pig ear .
i've been going to this facility for years and recently became pregnant . i can't even begin to describe the comfort that the staff here has given me about the care of my child . i was going through some difficult times with my father passing away and unexpectedly losing employment and medical benefits and the staff has been caring and understanding throughout it all . they helped me financially by moving around the normal schedule of prenatal tests until my new medical insurance kicked in . they have been a blessing with finding ways to ensure my child receives the best care . they are at times quite busy and sometimes there is a bit of a wait when things get behind schedule , such as when the doctor needs to be away to make a delivery , but they are always working to expedite appointments and keep things moving . i also had another issue , prior to getting pregnant , where another doctor's office unethically denied me birth control that i had prepaid for after my annual examination . so i came to this facility instead . the staff was empathetic and understanding and made me feel at ease after previously dealing with such horrible service . it's difficult to find a place that makes you feel like a person . here it is .
terrible customer service las vegas nevada employee i no respect no professional manager they need a training need to file .
really wanted to like this place it's close , i love chicken , and i love the grind , but they made it hard to enjoy . maybe just some opening week rough spots , but i can't recommend it . we made a reservation in advance for 6 , and they squeezed us into a booth that probably should only hold 4 . i can live with that . nice selection of craft beers and wines , and i like that you can order 1 2 or even 1 4 glasses as a taster . server was polite , but tough to track down . food came out slowly , inaccurately , and was just not that great . parents' request for white meat chicken was botched and had to be sent back . wife's order came out late and was totally wrong , came out wrong a 2nd time , but the 3rd time was the charm . the rotisserie chicken itself was decent , but nothing you couldn't get at several dozen other places in town . daughter's pork sandwich was practically swimming in the bleu cheese sauce guys , a little goes a long way . wife's fish was o . k . , but the chickpea side dish was bland uninteresting . creamed corn was very tasty , though . due to the kitchen server mishaps , we had to race through dinner even though we had allowed for plenty of time . overall , just nothing that would bring me back . too many other good options around .
great place if you'd like to be slammed down in a penitentiary oh and no cussing in the barbecue area apparently everyone that goes here also goes to sunday school every sunday someone blew their load in the elevator and it was not cleaned up for three days horrible vacation destination will never return and there's a 6 foot tall steroid it out security guard that thinks he's stone cold steve austin or the rock i can't determine what but if you're the snooty snooty type you'll love this place two big giant thumbs down
i love this place . sometimes the mats get crowded but that's a good thing because everybody is there to make each other better . instruction is really detailed and drills are superb . it is a great facility located in the good life right at yonge and bloor . that is about as good as a location as you can get in this city !
absolutely our favorite place to bowl in the area ! staff goes over and above to make sure we have a great time . i usually bowl with my daughter 6 and niece 3 and the music , x small bowling balls and great food make the experience awesome every time ! the bar staff is fantastic . i can't say enough how much we love this place .
i give this three stars based on their wings which were very good . mango habanero wings were very tasty but not very spicy . the service was also very good . husband had pork sliders that were just average . what turned me off was the super loud dj music . i would have been ok with the music selection but it was so loud i had to really shout for my husband to hear me . seems like an odd choice to have a dj in a pub .
server was ok . nothing special . should have been a little more attentive as it was fairly dead in there . today i ordered the bacon temptation omelette . i'm still not sure how i feel about the cold tomatoes on top and the cheese sauce . overall it's ihop . not bad prices . kids eat free which is nice . we'll be back at some point but there are definitely better places out there to go .
my go to place in vegas when i'm craving indian food ! this place is pretty good , they have all my faves including chicken tikka masala and the fried donut balls are amazing ! the only thing is that this place is a little on the pricier side for a buffet and last time we went they were really understaffed and we had to wait a long time for the waiter to get us water , drinks , naan bread etc . i think they had 2 waiters for the whole restaurant . overall i still like this place a lot and would come back !
i have been a fios customer for six years and will not be reupping again . two years ago , after i agreed to a two year contract , they insisted that i either buy a pricey new router from them or a monthly $ 2 . 80 plus taxes router maintenance fee would be added to my bill . it is two years later and my old router is still doing just fine . this was just a money grab by them . i tried to protest this via josh shapiro's office but got nowhere . i just got my new bill and they have raised the package price yet again . they will rip you off any chance they get .
hidden restaurant in the same plaza as subway and starbucks . came here for some raw fish bowl and brown rice mixed with some of their house sauce and toppings . the choices of style to order are either a bowl or burrito . i prefer a bowl because it seems you get more bang for the buck and you could mix it up when you're eating . the sizes for the bowls to choose from is small 1 scoop , medium 2 scoop and large 3 scoop of protein . i'm a hungry fella so i went for the large . i ordered their white tun , spicy salmon and yellowtail with brown rice . i added some seaweed , crab , avocado , cucumber and their miso sauce . prices were reasonable and be careful some of their toppings are 50 cents extra charge and it adds up pretty quick . the servers were pretty nice and helpful and made sure we sampled a few things before we ordered to make sure we liked it . the inside of the restaurant was pretty clean and i liked the interior design of the place . thank you very much and we'll be coming back soon !
amazing ! i've found my new providers which is not an easy task ! dr . sam fereidouni and kim brabentz , as well as the entire staff are spectacular ! thank you all for the exceptional services and care . truly the best i've ever had . i'm so glad i found aveon health such a dynamic team of truly caring people . you can tell that this team genuinely loves what they do for their patience's .
lunch break need not be boring with craft burgers around ! around 1 every seat was filled but that was ok with me because i had already decided on taking it to go . i was served with a smile and was grateful that i had looked at the online menu before coming in . i looked like a regular , not glancing at the menu and just ordering craft spicy combo fries . i waited at the side , close to the washrooms until someone came out , called my name and handed me a brown paper stuffed with my goodies and stamped with the craft burger logo . all this with about a two minute wait . off to enjoy . come devouring time i was starving the food was more filling than one would think ! that's because this stuff is real . the hamburger came out of its foil with the bun already a bit soaked from the juices of caramelized onions . to some this may be unappealing but to me with as inviting as an enormous welcome mat . the burger itself was the perfect temperature , juicy and made the whole experience . the toppings of caramelized onions and spicy chipotle mayo were so on the money that i don't think that burger left my hands until i was done . tomato and lettuce are always nice from crunch and taste but were certainly not the stars of the burger . no , each bite i was picking up something new and great . the only disappointment was the fries . they just didn't have that fresh from the fryer taste . so this was a bit of splurge for a simple , lunch break meal coming in around eleven dollars but it was worth breaking the piggy bank .
i've been wanting to try this joint out since i'm a lover of all south of the border foods . barroco has a really great , welcoming vibe . upon entry for friday happy hour , my husband and i were greeted with a complimentary reposado tequila shot in a lime bowl . any place that does this is dope in my book . for clarification , they only do this for the first 100 customers . unsure if that means for the day or evening service , but we were beneficiaries ! had a seat at the bar , which was pretty crowded at 5pm and were quickly greeted by the bartender . he happily explained the happy hour specials half price cocktails , discounted beers and half off appetizers . i chose the red sangria , hubs chose the house mojito and we both chose an appetizer , empanadas and marranitas . drinks were really solid and i love a bar that doesn't skimp on the garnish ! the marranitas appetizer was great ! the queso on the marranitas was soooo good . they have a carousel of different flavored aiolis , i highly recommend the spicy i believe it was habenero and garlic . the chimichurri was mayonnaise based which i thought odd and did not like . the empanadas were a little too greasy for my liking , but we didn't have an issue finishing them . total bill under $ 25 for happy hour . only wish we'd stayed longer when the guitar player started for dinner service , he was wonderful .
a little skeptical walking in since it was about lunch time and no one was here . and the glass cabinets in the front are completely barren . but the greek salad with gyro meat was awesome ! about $ 9 . not the most personable staff but nice .
creamy ! not too sweet and very natural ! i would have liked more huckleberry flavour in my huckleberry ice cream but it was still delicious . i even gave them some suggestions on new ice creams ! haha . they should have an idea bucket so ppl can drop their ideas of ice cream flavours if you're using gps in the dark . yes it brings you to a weird location . it's surrounded by buildings and kind of is at the end of parking lot .
called ahead to make a reservation because it was saturday night , but got there and found out we didn't need it , it wasn't very busy . not sure why , the food was really good . the service and food was a bit slow but otherwise it was good . they seemed to have lots of take out and online order pick ups .
came across this store randomly while i was in the west end . i found the service here to be a bit rude and dismissive . will not be returning to this store . there are plenty more cheese stores in toronto where people are helpful and friendly . bring your business elsewhere unless you enjoy being spoken to in a condescending manner . i am only giving them a star because the cheese is not bad .
all transactions should be so easy ! i called they answered and gave me a quote . i agreed and they picked up and towed my car with ease . the tow truck driver was friendly and knowledgeable , and had my car delivered quickly . and the fee they quoted a good deal i called around was the fee i paid . nothing hidden . i highly recommend !
when i need to ship something via ups and want a hassle free experience , i go here . i get service with a smile , help with making sure my packages don't fly open when ups plays freight football with it , and they have copy machines for the times i seem to run out of printer ink and need a copy of something .
who ever opened this canters does not have any clue about chicken soup or any other thing its awful and very expensive good luck hope you survive with the wealthy people cause you will not survive here in vegas . this is a locals town . hopefully the canters in los angeles takes over cause you do not have an idea what los angeles tasted .
it's an odd place a former brothel that's reputed to be haunted , with a lot of dark polished wood decor . in all the times i've been there , it's never once been crowded . it's very noirish , even in the daytime the sort of place you'd go to watch horse races desperately , of course , on which you'd just bet it all . and the guy at the other end of the bar hasn't been home in years , and the ominous bartender has a dark secret , and you'd better keep your damn beak out of it ! except the bartenders here are actually quite warm , and not ominous at all . in fact , they're more than willing to learn your preferred arcane beverage recipes . one guy there , frank , actually keeps a little book of new recipes he learns from customers , which i appreciated quite a bit . i also really enjoy the appetizers here , especially the flatbreads and the bruschetta , which are probably the least noirish foods imaginable . so , ignore your instincts about this spooky seeming place and check it out . the entrees are not terribly impressive , but it's a great stop for an evening with other plans in it .
absolutely adored this venue . as a destination wedding i had amazing anxiety attempting to pick a venue . i fell in love with the garden chapel . then at the last minute we asked for a reception with a bar as well . thy listened to what we wanted and they delivered . no hassle . the wedding whole experience was amazing . and the photos ? buy the darn packages . so worth it . thank you all so much . looking forward to the youtube slide show for our family who couldn't make the trip .
a new location , some of the same staff , and still not a fan of the food . after an intense workout , i needed some food in me . i had tried babystacks before with my sister and found it mediocre . part of my distaste was due to their lack of proper staffing and attention to their guest . with an additional location , it reduces the wait time and the business for both locations . our server , mikey was nice . came around , took our orders , refilled my water . another girl came around and offer me refills when she saw my cup empty . the service is not the focus of my dislike of this place . it was the food . i got the red velvet pancakes as my meal . a full stack of these hot cakes is overkill . they come out with six large disks topped with chocolate chips , whipped cream , and their cream cheese frosting . a few bites in and my teeth were feeling achy . the syrup was unnecessary since the pancakes are already too sweet on their own . i finished two of the six and was done . my friend was insistent on getting a half order of pb chocolate chip pancakes and a eggs and sausage plate . the pancakes are heavy and the savory items are just average . their eggs are executed well and the hash browns had a nice golden crisp .
if you are staying at or near union square in pittsburgh , you have a lot of choices for food . tonight a large group 12 of fellow business travelers and i decided to try the grand concourse . we had heard the menu offerings were quite extensive . i would have to somewhat agree , although it was mostly fish . not being a fish person i had to choose between a salad , steak or 1 chicken option . i forget the name , but i would have to say that the chicken was delicious . it was a chicken cutlet , with mozzarella slices and herbs melted on top , served over pesto . honestly , the pesto was starchy and a little plain . if i had the option i would have opted for 2 of the fantastic chicken cutlets and they could keep the pesto . my wedge salad was delicious but a little light on dressing . that said , how can a salad topped with bacon and blue cheese be bad . as for atmosphere , the place is beautiful . i would almost call it majestic . maybe impressive is a better description . i will come back with a group , but will likely try other places first .
i've been a client for the past two years . my review is mixed because i do like going there but , sometimes , i have my disappoints with them . like that one time , i paid a hefty co pay just so the pa could tell me there was nothing to be done for that particular appointment . i was like . i paid all that for that . also , they are very rigid with their tardy policy . however , they have shown me mercy once or twice when i showed up late . i get it . it's a place of business .
today was my first visit to the parlor and i loved every moment ! i followed cole from the centennial hills salon and spa and i am much happier going to the parlor ! the atmosphere is very relaxed and i loved the decor and location ! most of all i love my hairstylist ! cole gives one hell of an a line cut and a wonderful shampoo blow dry ! i couldn't be more pleased ! thank you cole !
awesome service , if you live in the qc area you need to request freddy ! he's the man . been using them for 3 years now and have never had a bug in the house , or a scorpion for that matter and for out here that is a big deal . highly recommended !
two thumbs up , you can get a mountain golf course view or pool view stay and if you can get a hot stone spa message
i convinced the other half to forego the trusty red robin for a more unique burger experience , and we ended up trying a basil mascarpone and a de niro burger . we were thoroughly satisfied with our choices ! the burgers were cooked to order , and the unique toppings were perfectly complimentary . as always , the folks there were friendly and cared about our experience . i recommend the fries extra crispy , but if you're in the mood for less of a side , the pasta salad was small yet tasty .
even though they were busy as usual , aaron was very nice he even came around the counter to give me my almond croissant at the exact time the barista called my name for my drink . keep it up !
yum , yum , yum ! no other was to describe it ! i swear i have dreams about their tacos at night lol ! most def worth the money !
i was actually expecting the worst from my first impressions but by the end it wasn't that bad . i would have given it a 3 . 5 star . girl at the front needs to learn how to smile . zero character ! tables were dirty and had to ask them to clean it . but the food was half decent . nothing to what i am used to when i am in hong kong where i normally have my korean bbq fix . would i go back ? maybe but i always do in hk !
we ate at the new restaurant in north scottsdale on hayden road . i must say it was more than disappointing . after seeing it reviewed on check please arizona we thought we would try it although it was the one on camelback that they reviewed . this one just recently opened . the restaurant is dark and dreary inside , so we opted to eat outdoors . the menu is very limited , for someone who doesn't want a burger . although , that is what we went for . my husband , who has probably tried every good burger in town , said this one just doesn't make it . i agreed . the meat was mushy inside , and the cheese had an overwhelming taste . i ordered swissand my husband had white cheddar . the onion rings , which were tempura style , were underdone and the potato sticks were like eating matchsticks . although , i've never had the pleasure of trying a matchstick . the only redeeming thing about eating there was gavin , our server , who really tried to make our dining experience and fun one .
stayed in one of the suites a couple months ago for a bachelorette party and it was spectacular . the room was huge and very very nicely decorated . we all had our own space and it never felt like it got too crowded .
for a cheap pizza place this place is not bad at all . 1 . the prices are pretty fair . 2 . the pizza is pretty good for the price . 3 . the staff is nice and respectful . 4 . looks clean inside . i like marcos it's not a fancy pizza place but it gets the job done . if i want a pizza to watch the sports i would order from here . overall i give marcos 7 10
worst experience . lazy subcontractors . i have a photo of them taking a nap the foreman has not ever returned a phone call or text . his supervisor is looking for any excuse to cover for him . we are two weeks behind schedule due to their ineptness . they do not seem to be at all interested in the project and the city did not pass the first inspection . stay away !
ok so we ordered chicken strips , regular fries , poutine fries and a classic burger with grilled mushrooms pepper jack cheese . everything tasted like they dumped a pound of salt on everything . only thing was missing was serving saltwater with the meal ! service was good bartender took of the poutine fries .
if you can manage to avoid the occasional torrential downpour , the three rivers arts fest is a must for any traveler or local wishing to take in the many cultural and artistic offerings . you can catch a free concert , browse the artists market or savor in the many culinary delights .
this starbucks has a pretty good service ! hey novody is perfect but good intentions are always there . keep up your good work people
i love this gym . i've been going to this for years ever since golds on sahara closed its fairly expensive compared to other gyms but it's worth it . no douche bags around to annoy you by their usual antics they all go to lvac . all the trainers are fit so if you ever need a trainer they all know what they are doing . plus the staff is nice and their supplements and gear are usually on sale . oh and they hey an awesome trx training system for everyone to use . something i haven't seen at other gyms .
i've been there for lunch and dinner . coming from asia and california , i feel that it's typical americanized salty asian cuisine . it's still taste good though . it's just very oily and high in sodium . if you're looking for hot food , this is one of the few places in town where you can get it . the menu list the spice level up to 4 star . there is a 5 star level if you ask for it . some friends of mine who snack on raw jalapeno peppers cried when they ate their meal . i had a 4 star and 3 star today either i'd increased my tolerance or they'd toned down the spices . the service is very lay back . and the lady was considerate enough to leave a pitcher at the table . the restaurant was half full both during lunch and dinner time and not noisy . if you like to hold conversations over meals , this is a good place to go .
piggy's is definitely my favourite restaurant of all time for kbbq . i'm very picky when it comes to korean food but i honestly have to say that the kbbq at piggy's is amazing . it is on the pricier side compared to some other kbbq places like chako's but it's definitely worth the money . your order also comes with a variety of side dishes . on the whole , the side dishes are average not bad but not exceptional either . piggy's offers a lot of items other than kbbq such as bosam , pork cutlet and pork bone soup . one tip don't get the cold noodles they were awful . i've also tried the pork cutlet and loved it . the service is great but there is usually a long wait to get seated for dinner anywhere from 10 45min . i recommend avoiding the dinner rush that starts around 6 7pm and coming in for a late lunch early dinner if you want a table right away . the booths give you quite a bit of privacy but the loud atmosphere isn't ideal if you want to carry on long conversations with friends . overall , if you're looking to try some delicious authentic kbbq , piggy's is the way to go !
great italian food huge portions beautiful dining room with a separate bar and large party room . white table cloths and candles on every table . excellent homemade bread served as soon as we were seated . very friendly and accommodating servers and staff . my husband and i both had the 12 layer lasagna and were very satisfied with it and the house salad with homemade italian dressing . homemade cheesecake and other items were on the dessert menu , but we were too stuffed to try it . mixed crowd of all ages joined us on a saturday evening , but there wasn't a wait when we came in . we will be back !
what a great find although going to be hard not to spend there . stopped in because they sell frank lyman but found sooo much more ! great customer service without being pushy . can't wait to find more treasures . really nice people to do business with !
the sushi burrito was really good and the staff was super nice and attentive . and their pineapple cream soda was amazing !
this place was terrible , overpriced and a waste of money . the employees were not very friendly and the exhibits were crap .
eva's original chimneys , a place of pure indulgence and total bliss . last year i visited the eva's original chimneys on bloor st toronto and fell in love with a whole new way to eat ice cream and yesterday i managed to rekindle that flame . i ended up stopping at the square one centre before hitting up a wrestling show down the street and decided it would be a good time to get some ice cream . originally i planned on getting sweet jesus but apparently they are not actually open yet , but what i did find out that there was an eva's here and honestly both of these 2 toronto chains make me feel like a kid in a toy store ! this eva's location is located inside a store that features them , a candy store , and a place that sells japanese cheese cake which makes it really hard to settle on something . once i looked at the menu i knew i needed to get the s'mores chimney which had an actual name but i totally forget it . as you can see in the picture , this is a thing of beauty . the chimney is warm , kind of chewy , and makes eating ice cream a little more fun . the soft serve inside is very smooth and taste fantastic ! inside the actual chimney the ice cream is almost layered and even has a piece of chocolate at the bottom of it . what can i say , this place is magical and if you are visiting the square one centre you absolutely must stop in and give this place a shot !
located in downtown summerlin is attic salt . absolutely cool store with unique gifts . a variety of t shirt prints are available with funny messages . interesting socks for just about any age , although some seem more geared toward teens for sure . so many awesome things ! books , note pads , t shirts , one of a kind dresses , earings , a little of everything . just some interesting things worth checking out . great for unique gifts finds . looking for something particular ? ask monica , she offers up some excellent customer service . i definitely recommend giving this store a look . enjoy
holy crepes ! iced mocha more like iced crack mocha . i'm bouncing off the walls . si si me gusta banana nutella crepe sweet virgin mary silhouette on my morning toast , it was heavenly ! . and a punch card ? ! i'll be a doughy mess in no time . thanks yo !
2016 was a much better experience ! going after christmas probably helped to avoid the crowds , but it was still pretty busy on a weekday evening prior to new years . came with a friend for a dance event , and when that didn't go so great we ended up wandering the forest area for about an hour . the are several trees decorated by local area companies and organizations , very similar to the christmas in the park in san jose . there's a cute path through the area , holiday tunes playing , and a festive feel to the grounds . for kids , there are several rides available as well as photo ops with santa . there are a few different food booths , as well as a gift shop upon exit . for adults and teens ! with extra time during the holidays , volunteer shifts are available you can get small gifts and a meal while you're on shift , and an admission ticket to use later . opportunity village does so much locally , and it's great to see that their holiday event has grown and improved !
definitely recommend for brunch we didn't realize you can make reservations directly through their website so when we arrived on a sunday at prime brunch time , we were told there was a 2 hour wait . luckily seats opened up at the bar so we sat there instead ! i sent my bloody mary back because it tasted like cocktail sauce reason for 4 stars instead of 5 , but the bartender was understanding and quickly let me switch it out for a bellini . the fire benedict and egg sandwich were both great . we wish we would have saved room for the housemade sticky buns would definitely split them as a starter next time !
although a highly reputable and good product customer service is lacking . tammy is not helpful and very rude to customers . we had several problems with the installation and working with them to fix various errors with their work . the quality of the shutters is very good , but be prepared to have months of hassle in completion and working with them . that being said , part of the issue may be with the company who we bought the shutters from blinds 'n shutters this blinds 'n shutters company is by far the worst and do not recommend them at all !
the drive thru here is super quick and i would recommend it over going inside . for most other starbucks locations it is the direct opposite , but for some reason the drive thru is never too crowded here . most people seem to go inside to order and then sit on the patio outside .
this is a reflexology massage business , so think deep tissue meets thai meets acupressure . read the other reviews if you want to have a good sense of what to expect in terms of the differences between this and say , massage envy . that said , i feel sorry for people who had a less than positive experience here , because it is such a gem in my life . i know i can go in here and spend $ 30 plus tip and have a deeply healing massage from someone who is working their butt off to make my body feel better . it is a mystery to me how the reflexology works , but i don't care ! i have gone in with everything from a really sore achilles tendon to a tweaked neck and have always left with a great improvement . the last time i went i could barely walk without a limp going in because my achilles was so sore , and after they did their work , the next day it was like nothing had ever been injured . during the massage i had to kind of breathe through the part that involved rubbing it , because it was so sore , but it took care of the problem and then some . i also took my good friend with me last time , who was visiting from out of town . she is a body worker in a very prestigious spa catering to celebrities and others who can afford the best of the best . she was really impressed with the level of care and attention . the only negative i can see to this place is that there can be a small language barrier if you are asking for something out of the ordinary , and also , it isn't the type of massage everyone is going to love . if you're elderly aunt just wants to have her shoulders lightly rubbed with lavender body oil , this may not be the best choice . if you really need someone to work hard to get the knots and kinks out , and you are up for a little out of the ordinary healing , this is going to be a godsend !
steak is ridiculously good but have you ever had bad steak in vegas ? um , no , but , it's still really great food . i had no shame and ordered 3 batches of yummy free oven baked bread . we actually go to this stk often because we stay at the cosmo often . this time , in addition to the steaks , we ordered the waguya burgers with truffle a little too rich for me and i love truffle and the sweet corn pudding . you must order the sweet corn pudding . service is , of course , excellent . music ambiance is pretty cool . only complaint ? cold , cold , cold . that ac was a little too strong . i was actually incredibly uncomfortable .
excellent experience 40 northh in st . sauveur ! i ordered 2 hot appetizers filet mignon sausages with a mustard sampler and the asian beef spring rolls with a mango sauce . both were great . hubby had the crab cakes and he was very happy . for the main dish i had the o terre which is a filet mignon and 1 4 pound giant tiger shrimp . it was very very good , but i would probably skip the shrimps next time and order just the filet mignon . for dessert , we had the chocolate souffle for 2 accompanied with vanilla icecream . beware pricing is expensive . this is like gibby's . you are getting quality food , but you're paying the price . be prepared to dish out your wallet . for hubby i , this resto is reserved for very special occasions only , but we will definitely return ! service was professional and quick . ambiance is nice too .
a lot of people hype this place up and it's actually pretty tasty . their menu is pretty extensive and they have extra specials written in paper below their original menu . the cashier informed me they were out of certain dishes menu items , so be sure to get there early if you want something specific . the prices are also affordable and appropriate considering the portion sizes . tapsilog your normal filipino fried beef with 2 egg 2 scoops of rice . the beef was cooked as expected but with a garlicy twist which i loved ! however , they don't give you that much beef . instead they load you with rice and eggs . i was fine just eating 1 scoop of rice and an egg . on the side they give you vinegar and ketchup . adobo fried rice omelette exactly what it sounds like . it's a huge portion of rice mixed with adobo inside of a thin layer of egg . this dish could definitely be shared between two people . banana pancakes so bomb . i think this was my entire group's favorite menu item . we ordered the short stack 2 pancakes about $ 5 , 3 pancakes for $ 6 . 70ish and shared it . the pancakes are a pretty big portion , it fills the entire plate . for size comparison they are bigger than denny's or ihop pancakes . it comes with a very very generous amount of the vanilla sauce . the pancakes and sauce combined just melt in your mouth almost . would definitely recommend and eat here again the next time i visit vegas .
my wife and i have been nothing but pleased with our experience with pla . they have been so loving to our daughter allowing her to grow and learn . they allowed us to bring our own food as well as worked with us and our drop off and pick up times . we are extremely sad to leave but we moved to another house and our jobs would make the trip to pla too much . take the time and definitely check this place out .
the sweet pork quesadilla is yummy . my boyfriend really enjoyed his flame grilled steak burrito . it's nice to have choices like horchata , mint limeade , sugar free strawberry lemonade , and flavored iced teas , in addition to the standard sodas . they also have a good variety of hot sauces and a convenience station with plenty of quality napkins , lids for your leftovers , cutlery , etc . the portions are large . we went on a grand opening sort of day when they gave away 150 free meals so i expected to wait a long time . nope ! the service was fast , friendly , and efficient . if this is how they treat you when you give them no money , i'm definitely returning !
a pleasant surprise . have patronized most of the restaurants in downtown gilbert and chandler , and this little place has quality as good or better than any of those places without the overcrowding and overpricing of those downtown locations . strip center location a bit out of the mainstream but conveniently close to mcqueen park facilities and plenty of close parking . have had the hamburgers , southwest chicken sandwich and wings on various visits . all were good quality and freshly made . ordered burgers medium rare and well and both were done as ordered . meat is high quality . lettuce and tomato were crisp and fresh , not limp like some other places . wings were some of the best i have had . the sauce was spiced as it should be . the wings were not soggy but were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside and were the meatiest wings i have had in a long time . good authentic neighborhood tavern ambiance . it is possible to carry on a conversation without yelling . not extremely large , but pretty good craft beer selection . only down side is the selection did not include any lagers or pilsners , which hit the spot on a hot day . good for families , but not sure they can accommodate really large parties . best of all , this is not a chain . it is locally owned and the owners are on the premises . the east valley needs to support these kind of businesses when they produce good quality like this so we don't end up being limited to a bunch of mediocre corporate chain restaurants and fast food places .
worst service ever i went in for an initial eye exam and a sales lady basically pushed me into buying a way too expensive frame they cleverly pointed to the most expensive in the collection i had absolutely no idea what was happening and when i sat down to ask some question they made me feel like a complete jerk because i dared refuse the bifocals . 'no mam i prefer no bifocals because i lose my glasses all the time' was met with a 'well you should take care of your belongings . ' freaking moralizing salespeople . never set foot in there . a pack of wolves .
i arrived late in montreal . almost everything was closed except bars and etc . i had no interest about nightlife since i was tired and hungry . luckily , i found joe's panini . great tasty cheap paninis ! much better than the overpriced ones in nyc ! will visit again if i'm in montreal again !
great baby back ribs . lots of moist tender meat . chicken and waffles are good . baked beans and the potato salad are good . nice and polite employees . they need to update their menu on their website , prices have gone up . $ 3 4 on some items . nice and clean restaurant . i'll go there again .
it was my first time at this restaurant . i tried the hatch green chile enchiladas which had great flavor and spice . as a recommendation from a yelp review i ordered the sangria and for dessert we had the fried ice cream . i did enjoy the sangria very much and the service was outstanding !
this is not the first time i've been here , but this time , was treated rudely . my husband has a camera backpack and he walked in past the lady at the front who is supposed to check your bags . she looked at us , didn't say anything , so we proceeded into the store . we begin browsing and i notice this security guard following us around . he followed us and kept staring , making me feel awkward shopping . after a few minutes he approaches my husband asking if he checked in with the lady up front about his backpack . so my husband went to check with her and she said it's fine . strike 1 . looking around for gifts and there isn't much more than the chotsky type dust collectors . strike 2 . the coolest thing i found was used playing cards from the now closed sahara . awesome . grabbed a bunch and headed to the register planning to use my card . my card is under my maiden name and my id is in my married name . not once my whole trip did i have a problem using that til here . i was honest and informed them about the name difference but the lady refused to accept it . seriously ? my card is signed , my signature is on my id and you can clearly see the signatures are the same except for my last name . strike 3 . first time i went , great experience . sorry for getting married and having a different name because it was such a liability to you . isn't vegas the place to get married ? thanks for treating me like a criminal from the moment i stepped in the store up to the moment i cashed out . never again .
hrmmm im honestly surprised at the lack of 5 star reviews for this location . i have been stopping in here for 5 or so years and have never had one bad experience . i stopped in on wednesday , got a bagel with schmear and a large hot chia tea latte . my complaints are that the drinks come way super hot and the bagels always come with so much cream cheese that i have to scrap some off . seriously , and those aren't bad complaints , im just picky . the service is always outstanding and fast ! i never have to wait more then 3 minutes to get my hot drink and bagel in my hand . keep up the good work !
frustrating from start to finish . for $ 250 night , i enjoyed 3 attempts to check in because each time the line had no exaggeration 30 people on a thurs afternoon , not friday evening that didn't let up until 0100 the next morning only 3 staff checking all those people in then they want an extra $ 30 for gym and internet per day that's about 15 of my room fee and i was told you can't do just one or the other . the rooms are adequate at best , and i had difficulty checking out because their website wasn't working . the only reason i even kept trying was because i was afraid there was a hidden fee for not officially checking out . they charge for early checkin . this hotel feels like everything that's wrong about the airlines . about the only decent thing was their $ 25 buffet lunch that was the quality of golden corale . not saying much .
when i called this morning and spoke with rosie my intention was to get right in because my body was so drained . rosie asked me what my body was in need of . i appreciated that . rosie suggested mia , but i wouldn't be able to get on mia's table til 6 45 pm verses 10 am . i was cool with the late appointment because rosie assured me her style is what my body needed . i got there just in time . sue , the owner greeted me with a warm smile and gorgeous blonde dimensions in her hair . the energy in elements waiting area can not be bought . the energy there is so real and forceful that you want to sit and breathe positive vibrations as you wait for your therapist . aaahh , mia . she welcomed me with this blessed energy that she applied to my body along with lemongrass lotion . i told her the energy i needed to remove and her unique blend of reiki and massage did just that . her touch had me release energy that was taking up space and being selfish to the shift of my life which needed space to receive new energy . thank you universe for allowing me and elements to now be therapeutic friends .
we were referred to jereme by petsmart when our oldest dogs health began to decline and we wanted more personal attention for our dogs while we were out of town or gone for any length of time during the day . jereme takes care of our two bassett hounds and crazy cat and does an amazing job ! my 14 year old bassett hound has glaucoma and requires multiple eye drops throughout the day in addition to oral medications . i know when we call jereme sometimes even last minute my dogs will be taken care of and all medical needs will be addressed . he completely goes above and beyond in caring for your pets during his visits ! so happy we found him and the services he offers !
when i try to tell the kids how things used to be back in the day , they usually just roll their eyes and look at me like i am insane , because naturally nothing really existed more than a few years ago , and theaters have always had stadium seating and awesome sound systems not to mention dozens of screens . thankfully there is the manor . this old school theater is a remnant of what movie going used to be like . sure , it makes me feel old , but it is what we used to have . there were no multi plexes back then . well , i guess perhaps there were , but only if you considered a multi plex a couple of screens . now the old girl is relegated to indie status , but that is not a bad thing . the old chairs are not especially comfortable when you compare them to the high backs of the more modern competitors . if you should get there early or stay to the end of the movie , the spotlight from the rear of the theater will blind you , compared to the soft , ambient light you will find in more modern setups . definitely a worthwhile addition to the city , however . check it out if you get the chance .
warehouse is one place that never fails to disappoint . astounded by the price , i went here multiple times and tried out different dishes to see which one is good and which one is bad . so far , i have only had the best fish tacos and other amazing dishes . don't be fooled by the price , yes you can get quality delicious food for just $ 5 . i like some of their cocktails as well , the bulldog and the pink lemonade is my favorite . naturally their drinks are expensive as they have to make up somewhere for the profits . the burgers are good , quesadillas are a good appetizer portions are small though , nothing beats their chicken fingers and beer . i also enjoyed their sun dried pasta you got to add extra bacon ofcourse very much . this is one place i religiously go to irrespective of the line up totally worth it . the staff are extremely friendly and i love how they have named their card machines after celebs . highly recommend this place . starve yourself and go here cause you can never have enough $ 5 fish tacos !
chocolate brownie made me cry ! if you have a group larger than 5 people , i would strongly recommend either calling in advance or expect a significant wait .
quinn was at my house within an hour of my phone call and he explained how my particular garage door and springs worked so i could understand the issues . he was kind enough to waive the service call fee when my door opener needed to be replaced and he was fairly priced . he is an honest guy to boot ! i will call him again for future work and would recommend him to anyone needing help in the garage .
brasserie is easily my favourite restaurant . anytime we're in kensington and hungry this is the stop . most recently i had the eggs benedict with house made sausage and i wanted to lick the plate . every now and then the service isn't great but the quality of food greatly outweighs having to wait a few extra minutes . essentially i've never had a bad meal here and i never expect to .
came for restaurant week and loved the variety on the menu . we opted for the queensfeast menu and selected the following smoky tomato soup roasted cauliflower with spice rub the duck 3 ways with pear the red fish on this yummy potato , cheese and corn hash dessert was my fav part of the meal as always it was sampler w a chocolate truffle , tress leeches cheesecake and bread pudding this bread pudding is amazing , i would come back just for that the last dessert was mexican hot chocolate full of milk and heavy cream along with churros and chocolate dipping sauce . great atmosphere but parking is a beast on the weekends . waiter was fun and engaging . can't wait to come back !
what a great idea ! i wish seattle would do something like this ! tons of shops and places to eat and drink ! super cool idea .
i was really happy with the food , the lasagna is full of flavor and the smoothies are perfectly refreshing . bonnie is doing a good job considering the fact she's doing everything !
i just walked in and ordered the breakfast bagel . they made it fresh for me so it was hot and delicious . eggs , cheese , thick slices of tomato and chewy bagel for $ 5 . i would have taken a picture but i ate it too quickly . i think i've found my new favourite lunch spot .
i was very impressed with their lunch menu , which is offered even on the weekends score ! lots of options under $ 7 , some a little higher my hubby got the fish tacos . be sure you grab a coupon out of the sunday paper , or sometimes in the mail . 15 off the bill , or other good specials are always going . i love their bloomin onion it's a must try again and again ! endless soup and salad on the lunch menu was ok . i thought the potato soup was a little too salty though . overall , i'd recommend especially for lunch with the low prices and will be back !
it is nice to see the checkers back in a building that is a good fit for hockey . although i liked the accessibility of twc arena , it was far from perfect for hockey . the organization is doing what they do well and the move to bojangles coliseum will help keep them in charlotte . most of the renovations are nice and the ticket prices are cheaper . i look forward to going to more games here but will stay away when there are events at ovens and the park due to the lack of ample parking .
no offense nor disrespect but i'm a latino that's cultured around cuban cuisines from living up north , this is the second time in 2 years that we were disappointed . never again ! don't recommend , truth !
awesome food ! had the chili coney and double burger with bacon and cheese . fresh , hot and tons of flavor . my own personal preference , i wish they had shredded cheddar cheese for the chili coney .
2 words . hidden jem if i lived closer to this joint i would be here every single night . we came in for a sunday night open mic . cool atmosphere , great bartender . my wife had some noodles or ramen , next time we'll bring our appetites . great bar and staff . keep up the live music !
i remembered this place was the place to go for a buffet . it was new , it was hip , and it hit the spot . i may have been inebriated at the last time that i went so my memories may have been twisted . this time around , i was completely sober and clear and when i tried the food , i was a bit more cautious . the food tasted a bit more bland than i remembered like it was missing flavor . the pho option at the end was pretty disappointing . the carving station was a bit dry . the true saving grace for this place for my and my wife was the passion fruit drink and the thai tea ice cream . i was so in love with these two options that i ended up eating 7 scoops of the thai tea ice cream and 6 bottles of the passion fruit drink . that was me alone . i'm sure we had more than that as a table . however , trying the other buffets and hyping myself up for this buffet really let me down in my expectations , but they did feed me well and the service was still great . the experience that i had was still great and the choices are eclectic and some things that you would never have thought of trying such as bone marrow . however , in terms of execution in cooking and flavoring , it was a bit lacking and thus the lost of one star . still ended up eating 3 plates with mountains of food . still walked away full and happy especially after ice cream and the passion fruit drink . seriously those two were delicious .
this place is amazing ! the tropical salad is highly recommended as are the cochinita tacos . the atmosphere is classy and inviting . the chef is amazing ! he does a great job on presentation as well . go here if you are looking for highly authentic mexican food served beautifully in a gorgeous environment .
i go here for the chicken and dumplings . yum ! absolute favorite .
when we moved down to las vegas , one of my biggest concerns was finding a great groomer for our little dogs . after checking out the yelp reviews , we gave sherry at woof gang bakery a try , and she's done an outstanding job with them . they all look great and were happy as clams when we picked them up . so glad we found sherry she will be our go to groomer from here on out . the rest of the store is really great too . lots of high quality pet foods and treats and other fun things for dogs . this is a must stop place for animals lovers in north west las vegas !
we are repeat customers , summertime only . not only is there consistency w quality of teaachers , they promote levels as needed . my only gripe is grandma signed him up for too many days and they won't flex on no refunds . therefore our money sits on file till next summer . hope they stay in business . also , it's not common to get feedback from the instructor on how the child is doing . they are typically scheduled back to back with lessons .
the new ownership has painted the walls and ruined the service . we no longer feel welcomed or appreciated .
just took the last of my bulk food to the dumpster , that i had just bought this last week only to see bugs crawling out of the bags today , the winco bags . now i've got to make time to clean the cabinet and check my other foods for bug infestations . big waist of money and time , also need to replace the $ 70 of food i just tossed , real fun to be a senior couple around here .
this is a fun and relaxed environment , i felt so welcomed by this establishment . great place to go if you want to enjoy some delicious beverages with friends or if you want some peace and quiet by yourself . i ordered the passion fruit with black tea and milk . my taste buds were literally on cloud nine . i suggest this wonderful place to everyone !
bitter twisted has officially declared its secession from the united states , and the world as we know it , because the impolite doorman refused to acknowledge an unexpired u . s . passport as legal identification , something no other country , including the united states , does . two stars for flawless previous visits before the secession .
good food great atmosphere . had a little slip up with our party's order but ended up ok !
love this place ! my friend works here and suggested i stay when i told her i was coming for the weekend . the cost i'll just say it's good to have friends who work in expensive places . jessica , the front desk associate , was super friendly and incredibly sweet . she was the same person who checked me out , which was even better . she put me in a room that over looked the pool and you can hear the noise from the pool , but it never bothered me and didn't last all night . the bad thing is that one of the sinks clogged up and that's just from washing my hands . thankfully , there are 2 sinks in the bathroom . also , i couldn't check out on the tv , hence having jessica check me out . parking isn't ideal , but the property is huge , it's not like you park in front of the building you're in i didn't anyway . i think you have to pay to park close . we ate at toro and the service there was just as amazing as the food . i would definitely go back to the princess , especially when the weather gets cooler . the people here are so friendly and accommodating , that i was waiting for one negative person to annoy me , but didn't come across one . had the best time ever in az and a big part was because of my stay at the princess . i didn't leave the property until it was time to check out . next time , i hope to try out the spa . i would definitely recommend this place , just make sure you have money on hand . room service is expensive and you need a bell man to get around .
we started with wings , garlic lime parmesan . best sauce ever , nicely balanced with nothing over powering . then we moved on to the pesto pizza . thin crust , tomatoes and light cheese . but the last was a disappointing eggplant parmesan . skin still on and so thin that there was more breading than eggplant . should have stopped at the pizza .
went there for fathers day june17 , 2018 with my family 11 of us , food was good but way too hot and complaint to the waitress and she cannot do anything , no air conditioner and no electric fan , just had lots of ice cold water , my sweat was dripping and wanted to leave but cannot disappoint my kids and grandkids , conclusion will not go back especially in the summer months and spread words to neighbors and friends thanks mario z . reyes , m , d .
i've shopped at this specific sprouts at least 4 5 times . each and literally every time , it's been a negative experience . the workers here have severe attitude . i asked for a manager once to call out the cashier that made me bag my own groceries . i swear i ran into her again on my most recent visit , which is why i'm writing this review . at sprouts , when you have a return , there's no customer service desk for you to immediately take your return to when you walk in the door . very awkward and uncomfortable for customers to have to go through the store and shop with a return in their basket . i don't want anyone thinking i placed it there while i was shopping . but that's what you have to do wait until you're checking out . i walked in the store with a return and went up to the first cashier i saw and she nearly bit my head off . said she didn't want my return at her register , that she didn't want the responsibility of watching it . thanks for the nice store greeting , byatch . but then later , when i was in the checkout , another cashier gave me a scolding for not having a receipt . i pulled out 14 sprouts receipts from the entire month , showing her how frequently i shop at sprouts at other locations , thankfully and i said to her does it look like i'm someone that doesn't save my receipts ? anyway , 4 times the charm as far as running into nasty cashier's that pretty much qualify for being called the c word . and i'm not referring to cancer , although i think they are a cancer on this organization that i otherwise love . b bye sprouts on miller . you suck . you can keep your b's and c's and i'll just divert course and shop at the fry's signature on shea . yes , it's worth going up the freeway if i can stay clear of the b's and c's you allow to tank the customer experience . oh yeah , the parking lot here is abysmal too . peak hours are even worse when there are literally no parking spaces and you have to park next door at an adjacent strip mall . just stay clear . with so many other sprouts in the area , why sour your day ?
great spot to escape the las vegas crazy , and drop into a quiet little spot to have a drink or two and then you go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like . you get the picture . great cocktail list , and perfect for lovers of fine whiskey . service was friendly and fast .
the interior of the place , staff , and menu looked promising . the actual food , however , was disappointing . if you want quality food , you will not find it here . you'd think that if they have a small menu , they would be pretty good at making it . at the very least , you wouldn't think that you would be served your soft shelled crab with parts that shouldn't be eaten the gills . a staff member the manager , i believe noticed that i left most of the crab on the plate and thought it was a waste . but no , it actually wasn't . the crab was pretty much 80 doughy batter and the gills that you shouldn't eat . the concept is good but the execution needs a lot of work . needless to say , we won't be coming back here .
the salon is pretty and accommodating . staff is really nice . been here twice , first haircut was kind of blah , nothing to run home about but they did take me as a walk in right away which is great . received the worst haircut of my life no joke and my boyfriend too from vanessa . i asked her to give me layers she gave me bangs ? and used some new technique she said she learned but obviously did not master . did not double check her work because i have pieces longer than the rest that i needed to cut at home to make even . go to another hairdresser to have it fixed and he confirms that she botched my hair and i'm just going to have to grow it out in an awkward phase . my bf brought a picture and she mucked that up too . charging $ 40 for a men's haircut is not acceptable for her expertise .
oh how i love la tavola ! i have eaten here many times , and it never disappoints . from the outside , it looks like a hole in the wall but the inside is a cute , quaint , family run establishment . the best part about this place is that it's byob ! i usually get the shrimp and crab tortellini . it has the perfect amount of spice in the red pepper cream sauce . oh , and the homemade balsamic dressing for the salads is the bomb ! two small cons the service isn't very fast . be prepared to spend at least 2 hours at the restaurant during your visit . at this point , i expect it so i plan accordingly . also , they will not do separate checks . if you go with a group , they won't take more than 4 credit cards for one check so try to bring cash ! anyways , la tavola gets an a every time from me !
only have 5 words for you guys all you can eat mochi ! that was sooo gnarly and loved it so much ! the service was great and fast ! the workers were nice and friendly . the parking was some what convenient but a little bit packed ! overall it's a great place to get together with friends and family i would definitely recommend this to a friend !
healthy home cleaners has been cleaning my house for several months now . i wanted to wait before writing a review ! let me tell you , they are tops ! i like my home to be hotel clean and that is what i come home to . they rotate through every possible cleaning spot . the wood floors sparkle , the beds are neat , the bathrooms sparkle , everything just spick and span ! they arrive on time and get the job done . bethann is terrific and kelly , the owner , runs a right ship . i can't recommend them enough . and so much better than having a cleaning lady who shows up when it's convenient to her and can't get the whole house as clean as healthy home cleaners ! thank you kelly for opening this business , it's a real blessing .
came with a group of friends on a saturday night . its a very quaint place . yardhouse , sprinkles cupcakes , ghiradelli , fukuburger fame , pizzeria and among other restaurants and stores . it has a nice water fountain in the middle . plenty of places to sit around it . plenty of parking at the back of the linq . personally , i think $ 35 is way too much to pay . if you're local it's $ 5 off . regular prices are $ 25 day and $ 35 night . 30 mins actually went by pretty quickly . the pods hold at least 20 people comfortably . it has screens to tell you how high you are . what they don't tell you is that the ride doesn't stop for you to get on and off . so , you kind of have to hurry . it was a cool experience . glad that i had a chance to go .
we ordered for delivery and not only did it take 20 min longer than told it was wrong . we called to complain and we were told the cooks didn't believe us and they needed the whole pizza back in exchange . since people had had slices i had to decline that and deal with the picky kid complaining they didn't get pizza . very poor service in my opinion . too bad we order ed pizza from there often .
i have ordered delivery from this location several times over the last few years and it's not very good . i used to love pizza hut pan pizza when i lived in alberta , it was my favourite but since moving to ajax i find this location seems to overcook everything . the pizza and sides are dried out and over done . i wouldn't mind so much if it was reasonably priced but it's quite expensive . i hope they can turn things around but in the 4 times i've tried it's been quite poor each time .
i wish i could give this place no stars if that we're an option . i called in to make an order and asked of i could do 2 separate transactions . she said why you make this so difficult ? . i decided not to eat from there . can't give a review on their food . it can't be good quality with such bad service .
it's our second new year's eve dinner celebration at mon ami gabi . last time it took us 2 hours to drive back to our hotel 1 2 mile away so this year we stayed at a timeshare within a short walk from paris . the $ 200 per person special 4 course menu included champagne . our outdoor patio table allowed a great view of the crowd on the strip sans traffic , the bellagio water show , and later the magnificent fireworks . the food quality and preparation were top notch . the good sized oysters shrimp were fresh . the second course squash soup , fennel salad and foie gras were nicely prepared and presented . all in our party of six had the filet mignon which was excellent . the domaine chamfort vacqueyras rhone red blend nicely complemented our meal . the desserts were wonderful as well . the impeccable service made it a memorable occasion .
this place is so gooood ! definitely better than panda express . the owners are really sweet . portions are huge . food is cheap but good quality . it looks run down but you can tell by the taste of food why they have been in business for a long time . will be coming back again .
always great customer service with a cute clean shop and answers at all your questions . with warranties and good quality products . my favorite
mj i , had . etouffee , jambalaya , beans and rice with crab cakes . hot spicy with wrought iron lager . good stuff !
we order delivery for work on saturdays at this location . food has never been wrong . delivery has never been late . salads are huge but the thin crust pizza is my favorite . thanks guys !
i can't speak for everyone working there , but one older woman was extremely rude and unaccommodating . i am vegan and asked if there was a way to take off any cream or butter and she was very passive and clearly annoyed . horrible service i wouldn't recommend to anyone ever !
used to be called the hermitage . it was purchased in spring of 2013 by another company and renovations were started fall 2013 . some of the renovations are nice , although the new places still smell of cigarette residue . there also used to be 2 pools , but they are renovating one and cemented in the old one . why they cemented in the old one instead of repairing it is beyond me . now its just a bare cement slab in with some 2 cheap plastic tables and chairs on it , along with a $ 20 grill . looks absolutely awful . some of the people they rent to now are highly questionable as i am constantly hearing the young maintenance guys wife screaming at her children or screaming into her phone all day long . also , they shut the water off about 10 times a month for plumbing work and thats about as annoying as it gets i would gladly take back the old hermitage and old apartments any day . these changes have made things awful .
went here on saturday . good selection of drinks . the curry wurst was amazing . the wings were not so great . the ac was off but i'm assuming they'll figure out how to cool the place eventually . the place has lots of potential .
dined at the new mb steak last night and it was fantastic . i sat at the bar upstairs , which is absolutely stunning , and shared mashed potatoes , a parmesan crusted filet , the chopped salad , rock shrimp and salmon . our bartenders were super friendly and accommodating .
a very disappointing experience . i will give it 3 stars because the food was really fantastic . when you dine at a 5 star restaurant , you expect 5 star service . our server , jonathan , was one of the worst servers i've ever encountered . i'm a server myself , so i am very critical . the place was empty for a saturday night , we made reservation but walked right in . we placed our drink order and food order at once , which i can't stand . i would like a glass of wine while checking out the rest of the menu . it took 20 minutes for the drinks to come our appetizer and salads came out before our drinks ! we were livid ! we had to ask where our drinks were . never at one point did our server ask how we were doing , how our food was or if we needed anything else like drinks or napkins . we would've loved another round of drinks , but were never even given the opportunity to order another . at one point during our meal , he actually stood over on the other side of our table and stared at us eating talking to himself of what he needed to do next . i don't know if this server was new or not but we didn't care . we were so unhappy with the service and did not expect this from a 5 star steak house where our bill was $ 200 . unfortunately , it put a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back because of it .
this place is amazing and its a shame there's just two reviews , and i don't know why i've taken this long to review it . it's easy to miss this place despite its bizarre green sign , but you're missing out if you don't go in . the burgers here are big and juicy , homemade and actually seasoned , perfectly at that . burger to bun ratio is perfect as well . fries are out of the bag , so not hand cut , but they fry them perfect and salt them just right , they are delicious . the souvlaki dinner here is also great , you get 3 skewers of pork or chicken that's very juicy and cooked just right . but the potato's are the real star of the dish , out of this world moist and lemony . i recommend this place to anybody , everything i've had has been outstanding and the prices are just right you wont be paying $ 14 bucks for a burger and fries .
best chestnuts walk inside and smells so good ! $ 7 . 00 for 1 large cup of chestnuts that come super duper hot that has steam coming out of the bag !
impressed on my first visit . started with my peach mimosa . followed by more food than i could eat . had to try the griddlecakes for the obvious reason ! the staff was attentive . looking forward to my next visit !
i so prefer open pitt over kim's wings . i stopped by here last weekend and left out because it was crowded and no one was at the window taking orders . i instead called in my order and came back . the sauce is okay , but my big issue when ordering wings is when feathers are left on the wings , which is exactly what i got here . what a disappointment to know they don't take the time to clean their wings , makes me wonder what else they don't take the time to clean .
the food at yama is still excellent , but i'm getting fed up with how impatient their staff is for you to leave . our group goes once a month we know exactly what we order every time , so it's not like we're wasting their time being chatty and indecisive . i'm actually pretty conscious of waitstaff and understand how rude it would be to hold up their next table for their tip , and for the people waiting in line . but yama takes this to a whole new level . it's bad enough they often stick you in the most cramped , traffic bumping aisle ways possible . many a groin have brushed our table as people try to squeeze past to their seats around us . the staff have even literally lifted the table next to us , up and over us , to fit more seats somewhere else . if they could fit a 2 seater in the entrance vestibule where people wait for their table , i'm sure they would . i'm surprised they haven't removed the hostess stand to fit a folding chair and tv tray for solo diners . from the time we sit down , to when we're finishing our last roll , is about 30 minutes which feels pretty efficient in my mind . but at that point , they will come clear away all dishes and drop the check . while you're thinking about dessert , they come clear the papers and napkins , and 60 seconds later , they come make a show of wiping your table while you're still sitting there . 90 seconds later , they come ask if you need anything else , and clear the menus . 45 seconds later , they come take the soy sauce . if you have the audacity to sit any longer , they come make a show of wiping your bare table a second time . sometimes people need a little nudge to get moving , but sometimes it seriously feels like we're being punked , and these ladies could not be hinting any harder . there are too many great sushi places in this town to be cramped and shushed away like yama does !
this review is solely regarding the cosmetics section of this store . my wife came here frequently to indulge in some of the newest products . the main woman at the cosmetics counter sorry i forgot her name , was very friendly and always helped us find exactly what we were looking for ! they were always ahead of the curve and very well stocked . i highly recommend shopping here for cosmetics !
awesome service and probably the best meal i've had in cleveland ! try thee brussel sprouts !
ordered delivery and not only did they forget the fortune cookies which i see others have posted the same thing but the delivery guy ripped us off ! he claimed he didn't have change , so he took the money i gave him and just walked away . i'm not pleased .
this is the 2nd burro borracho of guys' that i have visited the other being in laughlin , nv very different places altogether . the menus are similar , food is similar but not the same , and the service there is great , here is awful . we were seated immediately , but not approached again for almost 15 minutes . we were finally brought water , then our server came and took our order for food no drinks order , no offer of appetizers , nothing . we complained of a filthy fork and placed it on the edge of the table we were brought another , but the fork remained there until after we left . we did get constant refills on our water , and we were brought extra napkins without being asked , but that was it . we were never offered drinks or dessert , just the check . we will never be back to this establishment the only one of guys' restaurants i have ever been disappointed in
love this place . we go a few times a month . usually there's no wait . good food . attentive host . fair pricing . i would definitely recommend .
this shop has an excellent selection of jewelry and eclectic clothes . and they often have half off deals on their clothing . every time i wander in here i find something that i desperately want . the staff is also consistently friendly , patient , and knowledgable . i've purchased several gift for family and friends here . i have also bought a pair of harem pants that i've worn almost excessively in the past year and they have held up quite nicely !
taglio is one of my favorite pizza places in town . i'm quite the sucker for wood fired european style pizzas with a delicious thin crust and fresh ingredients . i've been coming here for some time now , and every visit the pizza has just gotten better . though , admittedly i'm a bit sad to see the jackie is no longer on the menu it was one of my favorites ! bring a bottle or box of wine and enjoy some real pizza !
you gotta try this place ! get one of the bowls and share the portions are huge . the only downside was they don't have coffee . so good !
they literally just opened today , we are getting our suv tinted and we saw a farmer boys on the way ! great staff and kyle was awesome introducing us to download the app and get $ 5 off !
around five days ago , our bathroom lights went out . the fan and gfi still worked though . we moved a floor lamp in there until i could check things out . today , i tested the switch and got continuity . i wasn't getting anything at the light though so i went to the home depot and bought a new vanity light and switch figuring i'd replace it all . i replaced them both and still , no light . this is where i called 24 7 electrical services . their scheduler informed me they were slammed today so she'd troubleshoot over the phone with me . she asked me to locate the gfi in the garage which i did . it was tripped . i fixed that and voila , my bathroom lights were fixed . what i spent two hours on , 24 7 electrical services had fixed in a one minute phone call . literally , one minute . and no charge for the expert over the phone troubleshooting . when i need an electrician again , i'll definitely call 24 7 ! great work and thanks for the help today !
this is a great sub place . i love sandwiches and this is one of my choices to go if i want a good sub . the sizes of the subs are perfect . have yet to try the 14 inch but if you are really hungry , but don't want to go to over board , then the 10 is perfect . i love the selection of veggies and condiments to choose from . caramelized onions . yes please . over all , this place is winner . when ever me and my g f want a sandwich , this is usually our first choice .
can't decide if you want asian or barbecue ? this is a good place for you ! they have a nice assortment of appetizers and sides for both the asian and barbecue parts of the menu , and the same for the entrees . they also have a nice selection of beers and the las vegas staple of the frozen cocktail drinks . prices are reasonable , but if you are looking cheap eats , you're in the strip , you're in the wrong place !
i'm so glad i found this place ! it is super close to where i stay when i visit toronto and their shampoo and blow drys are $ 25 . amelia was a pro with the style and finished off by sealing it all in with the curling iron ! loved it and would definitely return next time i'm in town !
highly impressed with the experienced dedicated stylists . always a welcoming atmosphere , and personalized treatment . cannot thank you enough cesar noelle !
patrick did a great job cleaning the carpets ! i asked him to clean the couch last minute and he did ! everything looks awesome ! we will definitely use them again
wow ! wow ! i flew in from denver to have my wedding at the platinum hotel . christine and her assistant came to our hotel room to do 4 make ups and 4 hair . we let christine do whatever with our makeup and she did amazing . at first look i was scared because i looked different . i wear minimal makeup but i looked amazing but not fake . she is so professional and knowledgable and friendly and honest . i didn't really like her assistant because she was snobby but she did a good job with the hair . i understand you're tired but this is your job and this was booked months in advance .
i hadn't been to this salon in years and decided to give it a try after being unsatisfied with my last tech , who i have no intent to go back to because hiedj at mirage did an amazing job on my nails ! my old acrylic was old and brittle so she took them off , gave me a new set and gave me exactly the look i asked for ! i could not get that at the last place i went so i am very please ! i've been on hikes with these nail and other outdoor activities and they still look brand new ! it's been about two weeks now ice had them done !
beyond service janelle , scott , chris , and ginger great to deal with they will get my business anytime and strong recommendation to do business with this dealer . thanks for the true porsche experience .
figo has a great atmosphere to it especially at night . i've come a couple of times and have introduced my friends outside of the gta to the place . during the summer months , the patio can get filled fast , so it's best to make a reservation . i've always had great food and great service at figo and love all the pastas i've tried . my only thing to look out for is the fact that it's on the pricier end for a casual lunch but it's never bad to treat yourself every now and then !
great ny hero's . the staff is friendly and very quick . i have been there three times in the last week .
the wine is great , the owners are down to earth , and the place has a relaxing atmosphere . if you are in scottsdale , i highly recommend checking out the ldv winery .
one of my most fav places . their t bone is the best . the owner mahmood is a very nice and humble person , so are his employees . starting with their complementary soup , then meat platters with green chilli hot sauce , a sip of mango grapefruit juice , and lastly a cup of refreshing tea . all together , an awesome experience every time we go there .
for the price cheap ! this place does quite a good job . dumplings are fresh and tasty . the spring rolls are crisp and not too greasy with a really interesting sauce . hot sour soup was quite tasty . i didn't particularly like the pork fennel dumplings kind of an odd combo with too much fennel for me . but they tasted fresh and full of flavor just not a flavor that made my taste buds happy . the portions are huge . the large hot sour soup could serve 8 people . 5 normal sized spring rolls in one order . a dozen of the same dumpling . so this place would be best with a group of at least 4 so you could get a better variety of dumpling types . for two of us it was a bit much and the waiter pretty much does not speak to you .
although on the steep end for drinks , it's a great atmosphere and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic 2nd or 3rd date spot . the views of charlotte are breath taking , and the food is phenomenal . although i'm not too fond of the paid parking $ 10 should be free , finding a spot a couple blocks down the street was no biggy . great experience over all .
we were wary of egg works because , as an extension of egg and i . well , it's just not the original , right ? ! well , immediately on being seated chelsea greeted us warmly , making us feel welcome . it's the same menu , but could it be as good ? i'm here to say , yes ! the ensenada burrito my first try was awesome ! eggs and carnitas , mmm ! what made it though was the sauce . a perfectly balanced tomatillo sauce , not too vinegar y very flavorful . the service too was spot on , with perfect checks of our experience without interrupting conversation a pet peeve of mine . we will definitely be back . oh , definitely don't pass up their banana nut muffin ! delicious ! also comes in loaf form !
due to this gentlemens comments on social media we will now be looking elsewhere . ignorant comments on facebook regarding people who ride motorcycles is distasteful . oh well . please avoid this business and look elsewhere .
i know it's just a boston market and i'm giving it five stars , but i love boston market ! i could eat here every day . i just moved across the country and this type of food is largely absent on the east coast . i mean , i don't even know where one could be corn bread in all of oregon . good , wholesome , delicious . reminds you of home cooking . i love this place .
rio all suites hotel and casino is a very decent hotel for low price . it's located off of flamingo near the las vegas freeway i 15 which is off the strip . another year of my vacation time . i decided to try rio again . the last time i stayed at the rio was back in early 2000's with my parents . the room here was pretty cheap , $ 30 night . stayed for 2 night . it wasn't too bad . it got an great view of las vegas and the mountain . for $ 30 , you get a suite which is great for those who's on the budget or don't want to pay for a expensive hotel room elsewhere . they got casino to play and win some money only if you have good luck , restaurants including buffet which i am gonna write about in my next yelp review , and some other great stuff . bottom line , try rio for your next vacation time .
ordered chalipita de ceviche ! i do gotta say it was amazing . yummmers ! my bf ordered camarones ranchero and they were also yummy i recommend both .
let me start by saying , that i love sushi and every where i go i try to have some just to see what's the newest thing out there , having said that this place is amazing every single thing i had here was great . i start with the almond crusted scallops and it was fabulous the way they prepare its unique and it has no wired after taste like in other places the balance between the scallops and the spinach was great , i follow it with a seafood zensai which just by the name had me intrigued , because in the menu says that it comes with chips so i had to try it , and it was wonderful again it's like japanese nachos with shrimp and scallops just beautiful . after that i decided to have the real thing , sashimi so i order ika , hamachi , maguro , sake salmon , and super white tuna and it had me blown away everything was so fresh and delicious the chef , saul had a very good technique on the knifed , he offer me this house sauce that go with the fish , i was a little spectacle about it cuz i like my fish plain but i have to say the sauce was awesome it went really good with the fish like he suggested , after having all this i told him to recommend something good and delicious and he recommend the miso marinated black cod so i try it but i wasn't very exited cuz i have had it before and it's not one of my favorites but i never had it marinated that's why i give it a chance and it didn't let me down it was great as well i don't know how they prepare it but it was full of flavor and it had this crispy touch that i really enjoy , and the best thing it's that all of this was included in the ayce it's unbelievable , i was very happy with the service and the atmosphere in this place . and it's probably because this place it's not the best looking place out there it's in wired location right next to a smith's , but the service , the food , and the atmosphere it's definitely the best out here . i hope and wish nothin but the best to this place and i really hope they stay open for a good while cuz it's really hard to find places like this one . and would definitely be back for more , they have me hook .
i made an online appointment to have my brakes serviced on saturday at 1pm . when i arrived , i was told that there were a number of other cars ahead of me and that they wouldn't be able to take care of my car that day . i was told that the online reservation system didn't interface with their scheduling system , as the online system was run by corporate and the stores were indepently owned . i am glad i didn't make the appointment for sunday as i was originally planning , as i was told that there were no brake mechanics working on sunday even though the online system would let me set an appointment . they apologized for the miscommunication , and i rescheduled the appointment for 5pm wednesday , as i could only bring my car in after i got off work . when i arrived , i was once again told that they would not be able to service my car at the time of my appointment , as they were several cars in front of me . i was asked if i could leave my car so that they could work on it tomorrow . i declined . they offered to schedule another appointment , but i declined . once again , i left without having my brakes worked on . it seems that scheduling an appointment with them is completely pointless , as it doesn't get you anything over being a walk in . the customer service people i dealt with were friendly , but that wasn't enough to make up for the scheduling issue .
this place was by far the prettiest place i'd seen while visiting vegas . it looks like a damn paradise . the weather was perfect and the nightclub has its own pool . but they do not offer any sprt of seating unless u pay for it . not at all , literally . so being from oregon , we rhough that was a bit stupid . but the place is very very beautiful ! .
i love donnie and i watch the show . always wanted to try this place , but i didn't have high expectations . i thought it was a grab and go place , but it's actually a sit down place with service . i got the our burger and tater tots . the sauce is good and they do know how to make a good burger . affordable and crispy tots fries . will come back to try the other burgers .
i visited ltayh because i had purchased a living social deal , but i will definitely be back ! when i walked in , two employees greeted me with a smile and offered me coffee , tea and water . i saw samantha for a cut , color and blow dry and she was great . she made great suggestions and didn't try to constantly upsell me on products or services . it was a relaxing experience and i love how my hair turned out .
i've sampled a few things from their menu a few times . the cheeseboard is kind of skimpy . the crab cake is pretty good . the lamb pops are way way way too salty . they have a pretty nice wine and beer menu so that's at least one plus . another plus is their shrimp mac n cheese . yummmmmeeeee ! love the decor . it doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall type place . the service is fast , the staff is friendly . the chef has some pretty awesome creations that i still want to try so even though some things weren't to my liking , i'll still plan on sampling more from the menu . side note okay okay . i know i don't normally comment on the look of the staff at eateries but this place ? whoooo weeeeee ! the bartenders both male and female are so cute ! and the waitstaff only male on the nights i've been . yay for me is really handsome .
i truly enjoyed officiating at this chapel was fun fast and interesting . although i felt unfairly treated by the owner charolette richards it was a great beginning for me . for those who look to marry at this chapel it is a 50 50 chance of good or bad depending on who you will be serviced through . good luck !
i shop here weekly since i live on base . i like the store itself but two of the cashiers are awful . i try to use self checkout to avoid them but sometimes they're standing right there running their mouths and saying things that shouldn't be said , perhaps it's a cultural difference because they're asian but i'd rather they didn't talk to me at all .
i had heard about this place but didn't try ot until a friend said this is her go to nail place . i called in and made an appointment for within the hour . the receptionist was so sweet , i let her know that i am very particular i admit it of my nails , i want my nails clean and alot of attention on my cuticles . i went it , it was very pretty , the receptionist offered me a beverage and snacks . they have alot of options for gel . my appointment was at 5 30 , i was scheduled with bruce , he was great ! bruce was on time and we chatted the entire time , he even asked me about my request that i relayed to the receptionist , which i appreciated . my nails look great ! like , i said i am pretty picky . see you soon , bruce !
i have no idea how this place got 4 . 5 stars . their food is possibly some of the worst food i have ever had . ever . and that's pretty bad , as i'm not super picky . i've been to two of their locations and both times i was completely unimpressed . first time i had a burger . i requested it rare , and of course it came out well done . like damned rubber . anyone knows that once you go rare , you don't dare . go . well done . ok i was trying to be funny and i failed , but you get my point . and the food came in some crazy picnic type containers . shit you'd see if you bought it at the fair or your neighbor's bbq . second time was a salad . trying to be healthy ! ! the greens were pretty much all iceberg lettuce . really you guys ? really ? too expensive for such a lousy salad . if i wanted to munch on what was basically water i would've ordered a free water ! the one i created myself at old country buffet tasted far far better . the only thing it has going for it is decent drink selections prices and a nice bar like atmosphere . but tons of other bars have that too and good food to boot . like santisi brothers . yeah , count this place out . oh , their logo is kinda nice . makes me think the buffalo just drank red bull though .
always good . not usually too crowded . fried okra like you can't find too many places . glad to have a bbq option that my family likes . sometimes kids are hard to convince but the free ice cream sure does help !
this is clearly the best rock n roll show in las vegas . all of the performers are the top in their field . they enjoy performing for the crowd they enjoy what they do . if visiting vegas , and if you are looking for old time rock n roll , don't miss this show .
i cannot say enough good about this company . they did my 2008 altima today and it looks like a new car . they restored the headlights which were very hazy . they were on time and and let me know when they were on the way . i will definitely recommend them to my neighbors and friends . from now on they are my go to company for detailing my car . thank you you guys are awesome !
so happy to have a popeyes close to my place . i got some crazy good coupons in the mail for their opening . 5 pieces of chicken , two sides and two biscuits for 5 . 99 . that's enough food for this lady for a few days . the service is good and the restaurant is clean . my only complaint was the chicken was a little salty . less is more . other than that the food was great as usual .
sadly this will likely be my last time here . at least for quite a while . be aware when being seated the section on the right has a very limited selection of sushi revolving on the belt . the food is still fresh and ok but if you're not seated in the main section there are much better places out there for the same price for what you get . they recently raised their happy hour prices as well . that wouldn't make much of a difference but when you see the same 5 7 options instead of 15 20 like on the main section , it's just not great . if you're going to sapporo make sure you're seated in the main section not the one to the right . if you want a unique experience with great staff this is still a great place to go but once you've tried it , feel free to explore the other options around town . i will definitely be exploring other places . maybe some day down the line i'll be back but right now i doubt it .
i like their tortillas and their chorizo is really good . my favorite is the oaxaca special . i did not see it advertised as well . i grew up loving the one on mohave as a kid now they are in avondale . the family owned and operated business has got away from the term familia ! they started out very well loved in phoenix and as the chain grew with family the culture of the place also changed ! i still love carolinas but disappointed that the love for people and food got lost as they grew ! reading some of the yelp reviews sadden my heart that the crew and management didn't make it right . you should always walk away from this place with a belly full and a smile on your face !
a very , very good italian restaurant with excellent service . we started with a mozzarella caprese salad . the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh . i had a frutti di mare which had an ample amount of sea food and a rich thick sauce . my wife had a custom made pasta dish , also excellent . the service was excellent and the prices quite good for las vegas .
i finally got a chance to check out munch box ! i drove by it for so long , so i thought i should actually try it out . let me start by saying the service was amazing . the staff is very enthusiastic , helpful , and informed . the food options are awesome for breakfast and lunch with a lot of build your own options . i opted for the wrap which i filled with breakfast fillings such as eggs , turkey , cheese , spinach , mushrooms . the only reason that munch box is not getting 5 stars from me yet is for the lack of flavor that my wrap had . tasted like the eggs , meat , and veggies had no seasoning on them which was sort of disappointing . i will be back to give it another try though ! i also enjoyed their station of hot sauces and condiments which helped enhance the flavor of my meal .
less than stellar experience . greeted and sat down and drinks were taken right away but then after saying we needed a minute to order we sat for long enough for me to contemplate leaving because the waiter walked past the table 3 times and said nothing . then the other waitress walled by took the order . i asked for a regular gyro . she misinterpreted that as the gyro plate where everything is separate . not long after the order was taken we are brought 2 salads . i realized our food came with the option of salad or fries , but we're never asked . it wouldn't have been much issue but i am allergic to peppers and there were bits of banana pepper in the salad . the food was ok . not what i ordered per se . it was a gyro but on a plate . when i said a regular gyro i meant the kind in a pita , not the kind with the meat and pita on separate plates . my wife's chicken shwarma was a bit over seasoned . just an overall below average experience . i have been there a few times before and it's always just average for a mediterranean place . this time i am deciding to avoid the place from now on . food tastes good but not worth the annoyance
i came here for the first time to purchase a money order . terrible customer service ! i was told to use the atm because they do not accept cash , that was fine . however the atm was not working properly . instead of doing her job and coming out to assist with the transaction , i was told from behind the desk that maybe it's my card . smh . this will be my first and last visit to check city . i guess people no longer get paid to know their job , now a days it seems you can just throw out an uneducated guess and receive a paycheck . where do i apply ?
this place is absolutely garbage . i thought it was a one time thing , so i gave them another try . how do you mess up mozzarella sticks ! ? they were harder than the freaking chicken . i will never go back there again .
checked out luci's today . great food , quick service for how busy they were . the naughty nurse sandwich was very tasty , the hubby had a breakfast burrito which was decent and our 5 yr old had the kids pancakes with fruit which were outstanding . don't order the tator tots as they are nothing special but the side of pasta salad was very nice with good flavor includes asparagus , peppers and tomatoes . they have fun different flavored sodas and lemonade as well as a coffee bar and don't forget the $ 3 mimosas . everything else though seems a bit pricey . we had a great meal and will be back .
fast service and was clean . i was impressed with the food quality as the last time i experienced red robin was not very good .
epic times best way to enjoy vegas night life .
bleeeehh , this place should not be allowed to call itself a tea shop ! i ordered what i considered a safe drink , a drink which would be hard to mess up . unfortunately , the passionfruit black tea with boba was lacking in both tea and passionfruit flavor as well . it was like watery flavoring with sugar syrup . the texture of the boba balls was ok , not too hard , and chewy , but lacking any flavor wasn't soaked in any syrup .
my first visit i had dermaplaning done and i loved it my skin felt fabulous . today i come back to get a peel its not so bad i love this i actually got their package deal which i'm really enjoying , can't wait for the rest of my peel package and see the final product of my face
this is now our favorite new dessert store ! boba tea , delicious ice cream , the amazing freshly made waffle ice cream sandwich , baked pies and cookies , and more ! and the old school games are so adorable as well . will come back here soon .
i visited this nail spa back in november 2011 and should say , i'd rather get a pap then visit some of these sketchy nail places but i don't always have the patience to wait for a spa appointment or the time to devote to it , so i ended up here because it's close to me and i was short on time . i was expecting a quick but decent pedicure service with no frills . i was the first person in at 11am on a saturday and before i knew it , half the seats were taken . people who came in after me for the same treatment , simple pedicures , were finished before me . i had an afternoon flight that day so it was important to keep it under an hour . even though i had told them i was in a hurry and needed to keep it to an hour , it ended up being closer to 1 1 2 after drying time for just a pedicure . unfortunately i was given a bad esthetician , may , who worked slowly , yelled at the other women working there and managed to cut the delicate skin on top of one of my small toes while sloppily exfoliating with the brush . how she managed to cut the top of my toe isn't that surprising , actually . she was not looking or paying any regard to my feet as she worked . i might as well been an object and not a person with a foot full of nerves . i had to bandage the toe up and use a lot of antibiotic ointment before getting on my flight a few hours later . the massage and cleaning portion was rather painful because of the cut too . she was rough to say the least . i think the other estheticians were probably better since they had the other patrons done faster than me but who knows . even though this place is cheap and they take walk ins , i won't be returning .
i wanted a different kind of workout , found this place on yelp and have always been interested in trying boxing . i have belonged to different health clubs and done boot camp workouts as well so was looking to change it up . my friend and i went in on a monday and were welcomed by the owner , chris . he worked with us in a buddy session and tailored the workout to our fitness levels . we have been going for 2 months now and he has kicked up the workouts as our fitness levels improve . i was very nervous walking into the gym the first time but was greeted by chris and many other patrons so warmly . everyone has made my friend and i feel very comfortable . i highly recommend this place if you want a fun , different and challenging workout that is also very reasonably priced . you will see results thanks pro edge boxing !
i ordered the first time from gino's a few weeks ago after coming across coupons in the clipper magazine . the staff when i called to place my order was very friendly and answered my questions about the coupon deals . delivery was timely and the food was hot when i received it . the food was delicious . i just ordered again today and look forward to enjoying their food . thank you for your friendly and great service . i will definitely recommend your establishment to others .
almond raspberry baked good ok . with flat white over 10 bucks ? ! too expensive , plus every coffee shop must pay a terrible wage , constant tip requests .
i came here with 2 other people during first friday . definitely nice to have the american and mexican choices at one spot . food was good but slightly over priced . the drinks on the other hand were way expensive . i get that we were mostly paying for the trendy atmosphere , but it really wasn't worth what we paid . if you are okay ordering a drink and an entree and paying between 30 and 40 for it plus tip , by all means , give it a go . to me , that's more what i expect to pay on the strip for a casual entree and drink .
great eggettes , especially for the price . this is relatively new establishment at first markham place and has seen lines in front of the store since they opened . i've tried their plain , matcha , and durian flavours . an underrated aspect of their eggettes is that they retain their shape even as it cools . maybe it's the design of their bags to release steam ? but as other places may see their eggettes deflate or wrinkle up due to the steam , eggette hut's stay crisp on the outside for the entire time you're finishing them . the durian eggette , in particular , was amazing because you can really taste the chunks of durian inside . it's not just a flavouring , you get the actual fruit inside . when it's fresh it's a nice molten centre to bite into . this is probably my new favourite place to go for hk style egg waffles eggettes .
was very excited to try gators pizza , i am a pizza lover ! i entered the store , and was very disappointed to see a moving belt type pizza oven . in my opinion and experience , these ovens don't get hot enough to cook the dough the way i like it . i gave them the benefit of the doubt , and ordered two slices and a soda . the owner was friendly and efficient , and in just a few minutes , my slices rolled off the assembly line , i mean the came out of the oven . i got the slices to go , and went out to the car to test them out . as expected , the slices were limp and doughy . i like a nice thin nyc thin crisp crust with the cheese and toppings turning a nice brown color in spots . i always give a new place 2 try's , so next time it will be a fresh pie eaten in store to give it the best shot . there are several pizza joints in vegas that turn out an above average pie that does not travel well . hopefully , i will be pleasantly surprised on my next visit !
love this bar . great chill place for a great cocktail . bobby and rosemary are an amazing bartending team !
it sure is slightly cheaper , but exceptionally hard to reach and find . their selection is massive and well organized and there's even some play space . you'll find everything here from board games to miniatures to rpg's . unfortunately it's the kind of place that suffers from staff that is more interested in their computer than helping customers . it made my group question if the two dollars we saved on games were worth the trek out there .
i can not say enough good things about dr stile and his staff . the doctor and staff are professional and friendly . the office is so nice and they have the surgery center right there at the same location . the results are exactly what i wanted . i would not go anywhere else .
headed over to goodtimes bar in order to have a good time last friday night . i figured it would probably be kind of a weird s m bar since we had to ring a bell and face a camera to get in . kinda exciting , right ? not ! there about 6 people in the place not counting the bartender who all turned to see our group come in . awkward ! lol well this place was dead and could almost hear other people's conversations . and they were sitting on the other side of the room ! needless to say we had just one drink and didn't stay long . the bartender was super sweet and friendly . and the drinks were cheap ! i actually thought this was place was nice looking , spacious and clean . too bad it wasn't happening when we got there . it was 11pm . we wanted to get our dance on , the bartender told us it got going around 1am . since we have no patience it was decided to hit free zone instead .
i used to enjoy coming here with my mom every sunday morning for a coffee and a small treat . honestly guys , i loved this place . good atmosphere , clean , nice for pictures ! however i underwent an experience which lead me to never go back . it was my moms birthday so i decided to go and by her a cake my mom is allergic to gluten and since this is a gluten free and vegan bakery i thought it was perfect . i went in and asked if they had any cakes and they said they were would be getting some the next day so come in the morning . meanwhile this was on saturday and my moms birthday was the monday . so i go in sunday right when it opened and to my surprise they had no more cakes left . the service was horrible , no sincere apologizes . they told me that someone already called to grab the one big cake they had . this was so disappointing . not even a manager or owner could come and apologize explain . the service was disgusting , the servers didn't even know what was going on . i'm never going back because they are liars and ruined my moms birthday . you would think a nice place like this would have good service to match but i guess not !
best waiter ever ! montice provided impeccable service , with a couple of laughs on the side . he was an expert on the menu , and gave us his honest opinion on the items we asked about . we'll definitely be visiting again soon !
i went to kane co twice to get my hair done . they sent me to one of the newer stylists who proceeded to hit me in the forehead with her brush at least 50 times , pull my hair and basically left me feeling like i had just had a beating . not to mention , her scissors were not sharp . when she tried to diagonally cut my bangs by just sliding the scissors , they didn't slide . you can imagine what that felt like .
i had just moved to henderson and didn't know where to turn when i had to take a last minute trip out of town . i left several voicemails with henderson pet sitters here on yelp . then i called liliana's number . liliana is the only pet sitter who answered her phone ! she suggested we meet that night so she could meet my 2 cats . liliana and i hit it off right away she is very friendly and caring . the next day i left on my trip . liliana sends me a message with photos of my girls each day . this is very comforting to me because i know my cats are being cared for . even my shy cat has warmed up to her ! liliana waters my plants , brings in the mail and packages , and she has even gone to the store to purchase more cat food and litter especially helpful during an extended trip . liliana saved the day for me and i can't say enough nice things about her ! fyi none of the other pet sitters ever called me back !
this was my first time at this salon and the stylist cut my hair just like i wanted it . the location is close to where i live so i will return again . people were all very friendly and great that you can sign in online
stopped by for breakfast . was welcomed in warmly by the employees . i ordered the french toast combo . comes with four slices of french toast . three eggs . hash browns . and three slices of bacon . everything came out perfect . not greasy or over salted . i highly recommend trying this place . it's my new breakfast stop .
had fried rice wong ton soup your dad sushi roll , and din sum everything was delicious
won't stop calling . have been telling them for 3 years to stop calling me . really getting sick and tired of their crap . i can fertilize and treat my lawn cheaper than they can .
do you have a classic car ? do you love your car ? if so then you need to take it over to bobby at 5 star . the attention to detail is unsurpassed . the prices are fair and competitive .
in town for my boyfriend's 30th and i found this place suggested on yelp for american and i couldn't of been any happier ! we were going out for a night on the town , so this was the perfect place to start . right across the street from the bellagio fountains , we got to see three different shows from our table tucked away in a little private nook of the restaurant . service was great , dirty martini with blue cheese olives ! was everything , and we had the crab cake , chopped salad , and blue cheese crusted sirloin all cooked to perfection ! they even came out with a personal cake after i had mention via phone reservation we were celebrating the birthday ! will definitely recommend for future visitors !
0 stars is more accurate but not an option . all complaints , written verbal , are ignored by supervisors and the owner of the company !
oxtail soup and prime rib . that's all you need to know . this place is located on the ground floor in the cal and is 24 hours . the staff is very friendly . there's first come first serve bar seats or you can wait for a table . the prices here are cheap . you can get a pretty good meal for under $ 10 or you can get meal coupons too if you get a hotel package . i like that this place has a salad bar which comes with all the entrees or you can choose soup . it has a good variety . get the broccoli crunch salad . it's crunchy and tasty . i like getting olives , carrots and hard boiled eggs ! the saimin here is just like home in hawaii . the prime rib special is one of my favorites . it's not bad for $ 10 , however i've had good pieces and a few bad ones too . the breakfast buffet is also pretty good . the bacon was crispy and they even had portuguese sausage . but i didn't like the scrambled eggs , they were pretty runny . and if you gamble all night long , you can get the $ 6 . 99 graveyard oxtail soup special . it starts at 11pm . i wish they served it all day . no matter what time of day you go , it always seems to be busy .
fast friendly service . went here a couple months ago snf the line was incredubly long at the same time i was still out in fifteen minutes or so . the food was good and correct and the service was fast very satisfied . also my whole household loves chipotle and this is the one we always go to
so we came here on a sunday for lunch and the owner was surprised that we found the place since most of the plaza around us was closed . thanks to yelp reviews i wanted to check this place out since people mentioned the owners are from thailand and having been to thailand , thai town in la , and married a thai man myself , i expect nothing but authentic complex flavors . this place is new and opened just 3 months ago so not too many people know about it yet so i'm doing my civic duty of spreading the word and not hoarding this place to myself . this place will be crazy busy in the near future and i wanted to be one of the first few to tell you that i predicted it . i ordered the crab rangoon , yen ta fo , and shrimp salad which were bursting with savory flavors and heat . not overwhelming but just right . definitely up to par with thai town in hollywood . give this place a whirl you won't be disappointed . the lady owner is so sweet and if you don't see something on the menu that you want she will make it for you . now that's someone who believes in their skill and takes up the challenge for their customers . awesome .
great staff , amazing and made fresh hot dosa's . cater to all level of spice palate . most of the time rice dishes are not available which is an easy go for my lil one . but he loved indian crispy paratha dosa .
mediocre at best . the meat for the burgers have the oddest taste of old meat and freezer burn . like the meat has been left out a bit or something . huge portions i mean it isn't horrid but i do taste something off putting in the meat .
convenience and quality delivered right to your front door ! i discovered total cleanse while i was in montreal and i will continue to buy their juices as long as they are in business . my personal faves are green energy , lemonade and creamy cashew milk very berry tastes like candy , which is too sweet for me and coconut water is a little blah . customer service is first rate and the juices are fresh and of exceptional high quality so fresh that they have to be drank in a few days ! . for a 2 day delivery cleanse in toronto , it'll cost you $ 55 day 6 juices day . it is costly , but it's a far better investment than buying the sugar saturated juices at grocery stores .
we are from california and yelped this place . drove a little out of the way but it was well worth it . my son said his chicken fried steak was the best he's ever had ! the service was amazing and they seemed to have a ton of regulars . knew almost everyone by their first name . the place was a bit smokey which bothered us a bit but other than that we enjoyed our food very much
looks like a great place , and probably is for hanging out and having some drinks with friends . for lunch or dinner i would pass ! the positives good drinks cocktails . the negatives kids eat free every day however the waitress tried to charged us for two kids meals . my son's milk was sour . the cheese on the nachos was poured cheese sauce on instead of melted on . the plate was super hot when the waitress put it in front of him . the rice and beans tasted like they came from a can . i think you get the point .
